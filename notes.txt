Different framing of burden-sharing, depending on what should be split:
- mitigation costs: this is the most used as it is easiest to explain. The issue is that it is not specified how agents pay (or if some agents receive payments) and implicitly, there is no negative costs (transfers exceeding the costs) and the carbon price is not uniform. Used in .
- emission: this one is vague as it doesn't state at which date emissions pc converge (if they do) and whether there are side payments.
- emission rights: this one is the most accurate as there is no need of a BAU scenario to compute the mitigation needed and its cost.

Different fairness principles:
- equal emission right per capita: using this as a baseline, we can call 'grandfathering' any principle that is more regressive and 'historical responsibility' any principle that is more progressive
- equal emission reduction (in share of current emission) per capita: grandfathering
- emission rights proportional to current emissions: grandfathering
- costs proportional to current emissions: polluter-pay principle
- costs proportional to cumulative emissions: so-called historical responsibility but may actually have a grandfathering component

Surveys of population:
- Schleich et al. (Climate Policy, 16) find an identical ranking of fairness principles in China, Germany, and the US: accountability (costs according to emissions) followed by capability (according to economic strength), egalitarianism (equal emission per capita), and sovereignty (constant share of global emission) (see Lange & Schiwplies (17) for the computations). 
  Polluter-pays: Every country has to bear costs according to the emissions it causes (hence countries causing higher emissions have a higher share of the costs).
  Ability-to-pay: Every country has to bear costs according to its economic strength (hence richer countries have a higher share of the costs).
  Egalitarian: Every country is allowed to produce the same amount of emissions per capita (hence countries with currently high emissions per capita have higher costs).
  Sovereignty: Every country is allowed to produce the same share of global emissions as in the past (hence the proportional reduction of emissions is the same for every country).
other findings: international agreements are important but current ones are unsuccessful, people find themselves poorly represented in climate negotiations
- Bechtel & Scheve (PNAS, 13) find with a conjoint analysis on FR, DE, UK, US that a climate agreement is 5 p.p. less likely to be preferred (to a random alternative) if only rich countries pay (other burden-sharing are: pay prop. to current emissions / historical emissions / rich countries pay more than poor countries) [TODO: check SI that these are the verbatim] and 15 p.p. more likely to be preferred if it includes 160 (out of 192) countries rather than 20 => confirms preference for global policies (rather than only partial coverage). Finds that costs is what matters most: preference decreases by 30pp if it’s 2.5% of GDP compared to 0.5%.
- Carlsson et al. (REE, 13) find using a 09 choice experiment that Americans prefer capacity to pay > current responsibility > historical responsibility > equal emissions per capita while Chinese prefer historical > capacity > current > equal emissions.
  Capacity to pay: Countries with high income levels must pay a larger share of the costs than countries with low income levels. This option says that countries with greater ability to pay should pay more
  Current responsibility: Countries with currently high emissions levels must pay a larger share of the costs than countries with currently low emissions levels. This option says that those countries that are currently a larger part of the problem should pay more.
  Historical responsibility: Countries with a history of high emissions levels must pay a larger share of the costs than countries with a history of lower emissions. This option recognizes that CO2 builds up in the atmosphere over many years. Thus, countries with a history of high emissions should pay more because they caused more of the problem.
  Equal emissions pc: Countries with emissions per person greater than an agreed amount must pay, and they must pay more the higher their emissions per person area.
> "equal emissions" is a misnomer as this is about costs (not emissions) and it's just a more progressive version of current responsibility / polluter-pay, where high-emitting pay more and low-emitting don't pay. The result for US is compatible with the other papers as Americans agree that rich countries (or high-emitting, the diff is small) should pay more. The Chinese position could also be reconciliable once we define responsibility from footprint rather than territorial and that there will be transfers from rich to poor countries.
- Carlsson et al. (Ecol Eco, 11) find that Swedes prefer that "all countries are allowed to emit an equal amount per capita" rather than options where emissions reduce in relation to current or historical emissions and continue to be higher in high-emitting countries. 
- Meilland et al. (13) find that in US and France, most favored fairness principle is Equality in per capita emissions: "all countries commit to converge to the same average of total emissions per inhabitant, compatible with a controlled climate change" and second-most (which closely follows) is grandfathering: "all countries commit to reduce their emissions by a same proportion". 73% in each disagree with grandfathering when defined as "countries which emitted a lot of carbon in the past have a right to continue emitting more than others in the future". To rationalize these contrasted views with grandfathering, we can interpret them as: equal rights, equal emission reductions, and transfers. 
  convergence per capita (70%): all countries commit to converge to the same average of total emissions per inhabitant, compatible with a controlled climate change
  grandfathering (60%): all countries commit to reduce their emissions by a same proportion
  past emissions (20% choose it among their two favorite): countries which emitted less in the past commit to reduce their emissions less than other countries
  poor countries (20%): poorer countries commit to reduce their emissions less than richer countries
  cost-efficiency (20%): countries where reducing emissions is more costly commit to reduce their emissions less than other countries
Other findings: people prefer international settlement on CC even if it empedes on sovereignty, a majority prefers to target footprint rather than territorial emissions, median is that countries should be held accountable for post-1990 emissions, self-serving bias when judging e.g. India vs. EU, no shared understanding of fairness when asked to coordinate between French and Americans
- Dechezleprêtre et al. (WP, 22) find that equal per capita right > historical responsability, capabilities > grandfathering; that global CC policies are needed; 50% support for global T&D; strong support for global tax on millionaires; no free-riding. TODO: check FR, US wording

> Position making all this compatible: people want that every country engage in strong decarbonization effort together, with a global quota, converging to climate neutrality in the medium run, based on an equal right to emit per person, implying that rich countries pay and low-emitting countries receive funding. Where the rankings differ, it is likely because the definitions or wordings are different, and also because it involves different countries (Sweden != US != China).
- Schleich find support for costs according to emissions and against immediate equalization of emissions (but nothing against convergence to equal emissions per capita).
- This is just in contradiction with Carlsson (11) which finds that Swedes prefer the equalization (with a similar wording) to other reduction options. TODO: check wording of the latter.
- Bechtel find agreement that rich countries should pay more and historical emissions matter, but just that they should not be the only one to make the efforts. 
- Carlsson (13) find that the least preferred option in China and US is when low-emitting countries don't participate to the effort. Ability to pay is liked in both countries.
- Meilland find that convergence is the most preferred, followed by emission reductions of same proportion, disagreement with grandfathering expressed in terms of emission rights.
- Dechezleprêtre find support for equal right is strongest, although historical responsibility and capabilities are also supported. The quota system is strongly supported.

Surveys of negotiators:
- Hjerpe et al. (WP, 11)
- Dannenberg et al. (ERE, 10): measuring negotiators' equity preferences, regional differences in addressing climate change are driven more by national interests than by different equity concerns.
- Lange et al. (Energy Econ, 07): Mix of self-serving bias and support for egalitarian principle.
- Kesternich et al. (EEPS, 21): kind of convergence on ability-to-pay.

Other papers:
- Lange & Schwirplies (ERE, 17) develop a theoretical model (building on Buchholz et al. (05)), supported by data, justifying that climate negotiators (chosen by the citizens) have lower environmental preferences than their citizens and equity views more aligned with the other negotiators.
