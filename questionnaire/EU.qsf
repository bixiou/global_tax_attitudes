To limit global warming to this level,&nbsp;<strong>there is a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit globally<\/strong>.&nbsp;<br>\nTo meet the climate target, a limited number of permits to emit greenhouse gases can be created globally. Polluting firms would be required to buy permits to cover their greenhouse gas emissions. Such a policy would&nbsp;<strong>make fossil fuel companies pay<\/strong>&nbsp;for their emissions and progressively raise the price of fossil fuels.&nbsp;<strong>Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<\/strong><br>\nIn accordance with the principle that each human has an equal right to emit, the revenues generated by the sale of permits could finance a global basic income.&nbsp;<strong>Each adult would receive $30\/month<\/strong>, thereby lifting out of extreme poverty the 700 million people who earn less than $2\/day.&nbsp;<br>\n<strong>The average American would lose out financially $100 per month<\/strong>&nbsp;(as he or she would face $130 per month in price increases, which is higher than the $30 they would receive).<br>\nThe policy could be put in place as soon as the four major powers agree on it (these are the U.S., China, the European Union, and India, which total 60% of global emissions).
