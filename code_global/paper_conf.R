# 4 most important figures: heatmap OECD, heatmap support, prioritization or conjoint (r), list exp (table)
# 2 essential figures: heatmap OECD, heatmap support
# => write a 2-3 pager (1kw with 2 figures) on Word w Science's template, send it as submission enquiry to Nature (as one can't send full paper); then for Policy forum in Science (peer-reviewed at editor's discretion).
# => write full paper as a 6-page (2500w) in LaTeX or Word so it can fit in PNAS, even for NCC it shouldn't exceed 8-9-page. (It's already too long for Science's max 5 page).
# => Submission order: 1. Nature, 2. Science, 3. NCC, 4. Nature Sust, 5. PNAS, 6. Science Advances, 7. GEC, 8. ERL or JEEM. cf. Relectures/journal_requirements.xlsx
