# Conversely, Large_urban is mostly in 1; City_Town is 60% in 2 and 40% in 1; and Rural is 70% in 2 and 30% in 3.
# In other words, Eurostat's definitions tend to view a postcode as more urban than UK's: all UK rural are Degurba=3, while all Degurba=1 are in UK Large_urban.
# /!\ But, the previous analysis is made only on 28M people, as half of Postcodes are unknown to Eurostat (and we lose half of Large_urban population and some City_Town in the meantime).
