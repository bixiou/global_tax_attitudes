\subsection{Attitudes and perceptions}\label{subsec:literature_attitudes}

\subsubsection{Population attitudes on global policies}\label{subsubsec:literature_attitudes_policies}
% Our surveys fill gaps in the knowledge of attitudes toward global policies. 
% We are not aware of any other survey on a global wealth tax. 
\citet{carattini_how_2019} test the support for different variants of a global carbon tax, but their samples are representative only along gender and age, and as respondents face only one variant, the sample size for a given variant is about 167 respondents per country. They find more than 80\% of support for any variant in India, between 50 and 65\% in Australia, the UK and South Africa, and 43 to 59\% of support in the U.S., depending on the variant. The support for a global carbon tax funding an equal dividend for each human is close to 50\% in high-income countries (e.g. at 44\% in the U.S.), consistently with what we find in the global survey (see Figure \ref{fig:oecd}). 
Using a conjoint analysis in the U.S. and Germany, \citet{beiser-mcgrath_could_2019} find that the support for a carbon tax increases by up to 50\% % e.g. in their Fig. 4 the DE support for $70/t jumps from 26 to 39% with extension to all industrialized countries
if it applies to all industralized countries rather than just one's own country. % Variant of carbon tax is 8 (US) - 17 (DE) p.p. more likely to be preferred if tax is extended to all industrialized countries

In surveys in Brazil, Germany, Japan, the UK and the U.S., \citet{ghassim_who_2020} finds 55 to 74\% of support for ``a global democracy including both a global government and a global parliament, directly elected by the world population, to recommend and implement policies on global issues''. % (for example, international peace, world poverty, and climate change)''
Using an experiment, he also finds that, in countries where the government stems from a coalition, voting shares would shift by 8 (Brazil) to 12 p.p. (Germany) from parties who are said to oppose global democracy to parties that supposedly support it. For example, the Greens and the Left gained respectively 9 and 3 p.p. in vote intentions while the SPD and the CDU-CSU each lost 6 p.p., when Germans respondents were told that (only) the former parties support global democracy. 
\citet{ghassim_who_2020} also document survey results which show strong majorities support in each of 18 countries for the direct election of one's country's UN representative. % same as unpa_survey_2005 % GlobeScan 2005; also: half/half (majorities or not depend on the country) for “Global Parliament, where votes are based on country population sizes, and the global parliament is able to make binding policies” (Synovate 2007); also: (GlobeScan 22, not from Ghassim) in 31 countries: 77% agree that “Rich countries must pay for poorer countries do deal with the effects of CC” 
Similarly, in each of 10 countries, there are clear majorities in favor of ``a new supranational entity [taking] enforceable global decisions in order to solve global risks'' \citep{global_challenges_foundation_attitudes_2018}. Actually, already in 1946, 54\% of Americans agreed (and 24\% disagreed) that ``the UN should be strengthened to make it a world government with the power to control the armed forces of all nations'' \citep{gallup_seventy_1946}. 
In surveys in Argentina, China, India, Russia, Spain, and the U.S., \citet{ghassim_public_2022} find support for UN reform that would make United Nations' decisions binding, give veto powers at the Security Council to a few other major countries, and complement the highest body of the UN with a chamber of directly elected representatives. 

Relatedly, \citet{meilland_international_2023} find that Americans and French people prefer an international settlement of climate justice even if it empedes on sovereignty. In a 2013 survey in China, Germany and the U.S., \citet{schleich_citizens_2016} show that more than three quarter of people think that international climate agreements reached so far are not successful and that future agreements are important. % 73\% of people find important future international climate agreements, while less than 26\% think that international reached so far are successful. 
In Finland, \citet{sivonen_attitudes_2022} finds that a carbon tax receives higher support if enacted at the global level (54\%) rather than at the national level (40\%).

These specific questions are in line with the answers to more general questions. In each of 36 countries, \citet{issp_international_2010} find near consensus that ``for environmental problems, there should be international agreements that [their country] and other countries should be made to follow'' (overall, 82\% agree and 4\% disagree). % No question like this in the next Envi wave in 2022
In each of 29 countries, \citet{issp_international_2019} uncover near consensus that ``Present economic differences between rich and poor countries are too large'' (overall, 78\% agree and 5\% disagree). 
%* Also in ISSP (19): slight minorities (in rich countries) that “People in wealthy countries should make an additional tax contribution to help people in poor countries.” p. 104, but strong majorities everywhere that “People from poor countries should be allowed to work in wealthy countries.” p. 106

%* ISSP (19): Near consensus that “Present economic differences between rich and poor countries are too large.” p. 102, slight minorities (in rich countries) that “People in wealthy countries should make an additional tax contribution to help people in poor countries.” p. 104, but strong majorities everywhere that “People from poor countries should be allowed to work in wealthy countries.” p. 106
%* Ghassim et al. (22): support for stronger UN with more direct elections.
%* Ghassim (20):  in Germany those two parties that supposedly endorse global democracy – the Greens and the Left – benefitted, gaining nine and three percentage points respectively in terms of voting intentions. Meanwhile, the traditional centrist parties – SPD and CDU – each lost six percentage points due to their supposed opposition to global democracy.
%* Beiser-McGrath & Bernauer (19): Conjoint analysis in US, DE. Variant of carbon tax is 8 (US) - 17 (DE) p.p. more likely to be preferred and 50% more likely to be supported if tax is extended to all industrialized countries (Fig 1, 4). (Unfortunately, don't test extension to global level).
%- Çarkoğlu.. (15) International Social Survey Program 2010 data reveal that people in LDCs are less supportive of international agreements forcing their country to take necessary environmental measures than are citizens in the developed world [80% instead of 85%]. (‘for environmental problems, there should be international agreements that [their country] and other countries should be made to follow.’)
%* Carattini et al. (Nature, 19): 1k in US, IA, ZA, AU, UK. Each respondent receives one variant at random of global carbon price of 40/60/80 $/t redistributed as international dividend / national dividend / mitigation in all countries / mitigation in developing countries / domestic mitigation / reduced labour tax. Immense majorities for any scheme in India, small majorities for each elsewhere except US international dividend (44%) or mitigation in developing (43%), and AU mitigation in developing (49,6%). PB: very low sample size (~167) for a given redistribution, even lower (~55) for a given variant (that also specifies the price). Appendix also contains estimation of distributive impacts. Representative only along the two quotas: gender and age. Don't give the representativeness in terms of income (the third socio-demos that they ask) so it's probably bad.

\subsubsection{Population attitudes on climate burden sharing}\label{subsubsec:literature_attitudes_burden_sharing}

Despite their differences in the description of the fairness principles, the surveys on burden-sharing rules show consistent attitudes. Or at least, their various results can be made compatible with the following interpretation: 
Concerning emissions reductions, most people want that every country engage in strong decarbonization effort together, with a global quota converging to climate neutrality in the medium run. Concerning the financial effort, most people support high-emitting countries paying and low-income countries receiving funding. The most supported rules are those that appear equitable, in particular an equal right to emit per person. 
% When the rankings between rules differ, it can be due to the difference in countries surveyed, but it is most often due to differences in definitions and wording. 

This interpretation helps understanding the apparent differences between articles, which approach burden sharing from different angles: cost sharing (i.e. in money terms), effort sharing (in terms of emissions reductions), or resource sharing (in terms of rights to emit). Extant papers adopt the cost sharing or effort sharing approaches and preclude any country being a net receiver of money. Also, by focusing on \textit{either} the financial or the decarbonization effort, these surveys miss the other half of the picture, which can explain why some papers find strong support for the ability-to-pay principle while others find strong support for grandfathering (defined as emissions reductions being the same in every country). The literature follows these approaches to stick to the terms used by the UNFCCC. Yet, we argue that the resource sharing approach is preferable to uncover attitudes, as it unambiguously describes the distributive implications of each rule while achieving an efficient location of emissions reductions and explicitly allowing for monetary gains for some countries. % TODO? say more simply that the location of emissions reductions is flexible in resource sharing
% TODO? appendix with the definitions for each author, incl. us

Now, let us summarize the different papers' results in the light of this clarification. 
\citet{schleich_citizens_2016} find an identical ranking in the support for the burden-sharing principles in China, Germany, and the U.S.: polluter-pays followed by ability-to-pay, equal emissions per capita, and grandfathering. 
% \footnote{The survey of \citet{schleich_citizens_2016} defines these rules as follows: \\
% \textit{Polluter-pays}: ``Every country has to bear costs according to the emissions it causes (hence countries causing higher emissions have a higher share of the costs).'' \\
% \textit{Ability-to-pay}: ``Every country has to bear costs according to its economic strength (hence richer countries have a higher share of the costs).''
% \textit{Egalitarianism}: ``Every country is allowed to produce the same amount of emissions per capita (hence countries with currently high emissions per capita have higher costs).''
% \textit{Sovereignty} (i.e. grandfathering): ``Every country is allowed to produce the same share of global emissions as in the past (hence the proportional reduction of emissions is the same for every country).''} 
Note that the authors do not allow for emissions trading in their description of equal \textit{emissions per capita}, which may explain its relatively low support. 
Yet, the relative support for egalitarianism also depends on how \textit{the other} rules are described. Indeed, \citet{carlsson_is_2011} find that Swedes prefer that ``all countries are allowed to emit an equal amount per capita'' rather than options where emissions are reduced in relation to current or historical emissions for which it is explicitly written that high-emitting countries ``will continue to emit more than others''. 
\citet{bechtel_mass_2013} find agreement that rich countries should pay more and historical emissions matter, but that rich countries should not be the only ones to make the efforts. More precisely, their conjoint analysis in France, Germany, the UK and the U.S. shows that a climate agreement is 15 p.p. more likely to be preferred  (to a random alternative) if it includes 160 countries rather than 20, and 5 p.p. less likely to be preferred if ``only rich countries pay'' compared to other burden-sharing rules: ``rich countries pay more than poor'', ``countries pay proportional to current emissions'' or ``countries pay proportional to historical emissions''. %=> confirms preference for global policies (rather than only partial coverage). Finds that costs is what matters most: preference decreases by 30pp if it’s 2.5\% of GDP compared to 0.5\%.
% I have sent an email on 3/3/23 to get access to desc stats of Bechtel et al (19)
Using a choice experiment, \citet{carlsson_fair_2013} find that the least preferred option in China and the U.S. is when low-emitting countries are exempted from any effort. Ability-to-pay is appreciated in both countries, though the preferred option in China is another one, which accounts for historical responsibility. %that Americans prefer capacity to pay > current responsibility > historical responsibility > equal emissions per capita while Chinese prefer historical > capacity > current > equal emissions.
%   Capacity to pay: Countries with high income levels must pay a larger share of the costs than countries with low income levels. This option says that countries with greater ability to pay should pay more
%   Current responsibility: Countries with currently high emissions levels must pay a larger share of the costs than countries with currently low emissions levels. This option says that those countries that are currently a larger part of the problem should pay more.
%   Historical responsibility: Countries with a history of high emissions levels must pay a larger share of the costs than countries with a history of lower emissions. This option recognizes that CO2 builds up in the atmosphere over many years. Thus, countries with a history of high emissions should pay more because they caused more of the problem.
%   Equal emissions pc: Countries with emissions per person greater than an agreed amount must pay, and they must pay more the higher their emissions per person are.
% > "equal emissions" is a misnomer as this is about costs (not emissions) and it's just a more progressive version of current responsibility / polluter-pay, where high-emitting pay more and low-emitting don't pay. The result for US is compatible with the other papers as Americans agree that rich countries (or high-emitting, the diff is small) should pay more. The Chinese position could also be reconciliable once we define responsibility from footprint rather than territorial and that there will be transfers from rich to poor countries.
In the U.S. and France, \citet{meilland_international_2023} find that the most favored fairness principle is that ``all countries commit to converge to the same average of total emissions per inhabitant, compatible with a controlled climate change''. Furthermore, in each country, 73\% disagree with grandfathering defined as ``countries which emitted a lot of carbon in the past have a right to continue emitting more than others in the future''. \citet{meilland_international_2023} contain many other results, for example majorities prefer to hold countries accountable for their consumption-based rather than territorial emissions, and the median choice regarding historical responsibility is to hold a country accountable for their post-1990 emissions (rather than post-1850 or just their current emissions). 
% - Meilland et al. (23) find that in US and France, most favored fairness principle is Equality in per capita emissions: "all countries commit to converge to the same average of total emissions per inhabitant, compatible with a controlled climate change" and second-most (which closely follows) is grandfathering: "all countries commit to reduce their emissions by a same proportion". 73% in each disagree with grandfathering when defined as "countries which emitted a lot of carbon in the past have a right to continue emitting more than others in the future". To rationalize these contrasted views with grandfathering, we can interpret them as: equal rights, equal emission reductions, and transfers. 
%   convergence per capita (70%): all countries commit to converge to the same average of total emissions per inhabitant, compatible with a controlled climate change
%   grandfathering (60%): all countries commit to reduce their emissions by a same proportion
%   past emissions (20% choose it among their two favorite): countries which emitted less in the past commit to reduce their emissions less than other countries
%   poor countries (20%): poorer countries commit to reduce their emissions less than richer countries
%   cost-efficiency (20%): countries where reducing emissions is more costly commit to reduce their emissions less than other countries
% - Meilland et al. (23) Other findings: people prefer international settlement on CC even if it empedes on sovereignty, a majority prefers to target footprint rather than territorial emissions, median is that countries should be held accountable for post-1990 emissions, self-serving bias when judging e.g. India vs. EU, no shared understanding of fairness when asked to coordinate between French and Americans
Finally, in each of 28 (among the largest) countries, \citet{dabla-norris_public_2023} find strong majority for ``all countries'' to the question ``Which countries do you think should be paying to reduce carbon emissions?''. Asked to choose between a cost sharing based on \textit{current} vs. \textit{accumulated historic emissions}, a majority prefers \textit{current emissions} in all countries but China and Saudi Arabia (where the two options are close to equally preferred). %In Germany and the U.S., \citet{gampfer_obtaining_2014} also find stronger support for funding climate action in low-income countries when cost is shared with other countries.

\subsubsection{Population attitudes on foreign aid}\label{subsubsec:literature_foreign_aid}

There is an extensive literature on attitudes toward foreign aid in donor countries. Its main insights are that most people overestimate the amount of foreign aid and that only a minority wants a cut in foreign aid compared to actual amounts, especially once they know them. 

\citet{pipa_americans_2001} shows that 83\% of Americans support a multilateral effort to cut world hunger in half. 
\citet{pipa_publics_2008} shows that in each of 20 countries, a majority thinks that developed countries ``have a moral responsibility to work to reduce hunger and severe poverty in poor countries'', with an average agreement of 81\%. In 7 OECD countries, they find that at least 75\% are willing to pay for a program to cut hunger in half (at an estimated cost of e.g. \$50 a year for each American). 

\citet{kaufmann_foreign_2012} find that in each of 24 countries, perceived aid is overestimated, on average by a factor 7. In most countries, desired aid is larger than perceived aid.\footnote{\citet{kaufmann_foreign_2012} offer the best results on desired aid because (as \citet{hudson_mile_2012} criticize), other studies did not take into acount misperceptions of actual aid.} They show that those in the top income quintile desire aid 0.13 p.p. lower than those in the bottom 40\% -- which is very close to what we find. % TODO: ref to our regression
Then, using a theoretical model as well as correlations between the level of lobbying and the actual aid (controling for desired aid), they argue that the gap between actual and desired and is due to political influence of the rich who defend their vested interests. 
In \citet{kaufmann_foreign_2012}, the U.S. is an outlier: desired aid is at the other countries' average (3\% of GNI), but as misperceptions are enormous, perceived aid is twice as large as desired aid. Indeed, \citet{gilens_political_2001} shows that even American with high political knowledge misperceive actual aid, and finds that 17\% fewer of them want to cut aid when we provide them specific information about aid amount. % same for Hurst et al
Similarly, \citet{nair_misperceptions_2018} finds that the relatively low support for aid in the U.S. is driven by information on global distribution, as people underestimate their rank by 27 centiles on average and overestimate the global median income by a factor 10. 

\citet{hudson_mile_2012} offer a critical review of the literature and show that the strong support for poverty alleviation largely stems from intrinsic altruism. Indeed, citing \citet{dfid_aid_2009} and \citet{pipa_americans_2001}, they note that 47\% of British people find that the aid is wasted (mainly due to corruption), while Americans estimate that less than a quarter of the aid reaches people who really need it and more than half ends up in the hands of corrupt government officials. And yet, most people still support aid, suggesting that they have nonutilitarian motives for doing so. Consistent with \citet{henson_public_2010}, \citet{bauhr_does_2013} find that support for aid is reduced by perception of corruption in recipient countries. However, this effect is reduced by the aid-corruption paradox: most corrupt countries need more help. \citet{bodenstein_who_2017} further show that right-wing Europeans or those who perceive strong corruption in their country are more likely to agree that recipient countries should ``follow certain rules regarding democracy, human rights and governance as a condition for receiving EU development aid.'' 
Using a 2002 Gallup survey as well as the 2006 World Values Survey, and consistently with \citet{bayram_aiding_2017}, \citet{paxton_individual_2012} show that the main determinants for wanting more aid are trust, left-wing ideology, interest in politics, and being a woman (all positively associated). %Likewise, \citet{nair_preferences_2016} shows that preferences for international redistribution in the U.S. are netter explained by worldviews rather than socio-demographic variables. 
% heinrich_voters_2018 also show that the country's interest also play a role in aid support (as support increases when the donation can be in the country's interest) 

% Reviews, determinants
%*? Milner & Tingley (13): (highly cited but no original data, don't think we need to cite it) In 2008, 44% of American wanted foreign aid cut (american elections study, 08). fraction of federal budget going to foreign aid (mean: 27%, median: 25%) / should go (mean: 13%, median: 10%) (WorldPublicOpinion, 10)
% PIPA (01): when PIPA asked respondents to estimate how much of the federal budget was devoted to foreign aid, the median estimate was 15% -- 15 times the actual amount, which was just under 1%. More dramatically, when asked what an appropriate percentage would be, the median response was 5% -- 5 times the actual amount. And when asked to imagine that they heard the real amount was only 1%, only 18% of respondents said they thought that would be too much--as compared to the 75% who had initially said that the US was spending too much. 
%- DFID (10): Priorities: 1 NHS, 2 education, 3 support to poor countries, 4 police, 5 defence (p. 19). Show majority support for increased aid until 07, then median is to support stable aid (due to crisis?). It seems they don't give the info on actual amount though.

\subsubsection{Population attitudes on rich tax}\label{subsubsec:literature_wealth_tax}

We are not aware of any previous survey on a global wealth tax,\footnote{We did not find any using the combination of ``survey'' or ``attitudes'' with ``wealth tax'' or ``global wealth tax'' in Google Scholar.} though surveys consistently show strong level of support from national wealth taxes. 
In a comprehensive survey in the UK, \citet{rowlingson_public_2021} show that a wealth tax is the preferred option to raise revenues, that only 8\% state that total net wealth should not be taxed (with little differences between Labour and Conservative voters), and find that the preferred design would be a 1\% or 3\% tax on net wealth above £1 million. 
By asking how much taxes per year should a person with a certain income and wealth level pay, \citet{fisman_americans_2017} finds that the average Americans favors a 0.8\% linear tax rate on unspecified wealth until \$2 million (the highest wealth level tested), and a 3\% linear rate on inherited wealth. %This is consistent with the findings of \citet{chirvi_preferences_2020}. 
Through a conjoint analysis in three high-income countries, \citet{schechtl_tax_2023} find widespread support for a wealth tax (from 78\% in the U.S. to 86\% in Germany and the UK), with a preference for an exemption threshold at \$/\euro{}1 million (rather than 500,000 or 2 million) and little influence of the tax rate or tax unit on the preferred design. 
In 21 OECD countries, the \citet{oecd_main_2019} uncovers strong majority support for higher taxes on the rich to support the poor (with nearly 70\% overall agreement and less than 20\% disagreement). \citet{isbell_footing_2022} finds similarly high level of support in 34 African countries. 
In the UK, \citet{patriotic_millionaires_patriotic_2022} find 69\% support (and 7\% opposition) for a 1.1\% tax on wealth in excess of £10 million. 
In the U.S., \citet{americans_for_tax_fairness_support_2021} find 67 to 71\% support to ``raise taxes for those earning more than \$400,000 a year'', ``raise the income tax rate for those earning over \$1 million a year by 10 percentage points'', or ``apply a 2\% tax on an individual's wealth above \$50 million each year, and 3\% on wealth above \$1 billion''.
%- Gallup (22), US
%- Fight Inequality Alliance India (22), IA

% PIPA (01): what percentage of their "tax dollars that go to help poor people at home and abroad...should go to help poor people in other countries." The mean response was 16% (down a bit from 22% in response to this question in a 1996 PIPA poll). Strikingly, this turns out to be a far higher percentage than is currently given. In 1999, a bit less than 4% of the total spent on the poor went to the poor abroad. Sixty percent of respondents proposed a percentage that was higher than 4%.

\subsubsection{Population attitudes on ethical norms}\label{subsubsec:literature_wealth_tax}
% \paragraph{World citizenship}

\paragraph{Universalism}
% No need to cite: Buntaine & Prather (18), Diederich & Goeschl (18) Willingness to act for domestic vs. international climate action
Different papers assess belonging to a global identity (see %e.g. \citet{mcfarland_all_2012}, or 
\citet{reysen_psychology_2018} for a review). In the 2005-2008 wave of the World Values Survey, \citet{bayram_what_2015} notes that ``78\% of the participants in 57 countries see themselves as citizens of the world'', though the \href{https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp}{2017-2022 wave} reveals that more people feel close to their town, region or country than to the world. 
\citet{enke_moral_2023-1} measure universalism, by asking American respondents to split \$100 between a random stranger and a random person with the same income but closer to them. They distinguish different facets of universalism, and define \textit{foreign universalism} as giving to a foreigner rather than a fellow citizen. They find a home bias for most people, which may partly be due to concerns for inequality, as the split involves two persons with the same income, with the foreigner most certainly living in a poorer country than the American and thus enjoying a higher social status. 
That being said, a home bias probably remains once removing the concern for inequality, as 84\% of Americans agree that ``taking care of problems at home is more important than giving aid to foreign countries'' \citep{pipa_americans_2001}. 
\citet{enke_moral_2023} measure universalism and analyze its correlates in 7 countries, and \citet{cappelen_universalism_2022} deploy this method in 60 countries. 
In a lab experiment with students in the U.S., \citet{cherry_accepting_2017} show that a substantial share of people prefer policies detrimental to them due to their egalitarian worldview. 
% Evidence that people are altruistic: they experience higher temperature when they learn they are doing good (Taufik et al. 15), they are sensitive to self-transcending more than self-interested reasons (Evans et al. 13), 

\paragraph{Free-riding}

Although researchers have long explained the lack of climate action by free-riding, surveys consistently show that people support climate mitigation in their country even if other countries defect. \citet{bernauer_how_2015} show this for Americans and Indians, who both overestimate their country's emissions at one third of global total. \citet{beiser-mcgrath_commitment_2019} show this in the U.S. and China using an experimental design. \citet{mcevoy_prospects_2016} show that Americans mostly invoke leadership and morality to justify unliteral climate action. Using a range of methods, \citet{aklin_prisoners_2020} show that the empirical evidence for free-riding is not compelling, and that climate inaction can be equally well explained by distributive conflicts. Finally, through a review of the literature, \citet{mcgrath_how_2017} show that climate attitudes are largely nonreciprocal, and primarily driven by values and perceptions of the policies, rather than by considerations of what other countries do.

\subsubsection{Second-order beliefs}\label{subsubsec:literature_beliefs}

\citet{allport_social_1924} introduced the concept of pluralistic ignorance: a shared misperception concerning others' beliefs. The concept became notorious when \citet{ogorman_pluralistic_1975} showed that, towards the end of the civil rights movement, 47\% of Americans believed that most white people favored segregation while only 18\% actually did so. %\citet{miller_pluralistic_1987} shows that pluralistic ignorance emerges because individuals believe that fear of embarrassment is a sufficient cause for their own behavior but not for the behavior of others. 
\citet{pipa_americans_2001} has shown that 75\% of Americans are willing to pay \$50 a year to cut world hunger in half (the cost of the program), but only 32\% think that the majority would be willing to pay.
\citet{andre_fighting_2021} have documented pluralistic ignorance of climate-friendly norms in the U.S. Similarly, \citet{sparkman_americans_2022} show that Americans underestimate the support for climate policies by nearly half, while \citet{drews_biased_2022} document pluralistic ignorance of carbon tax support in Spain. 
\citet{geiger_climate_2016} show that pluralistic ignorance about concern for climate change leads people to talk less about it as many self-silence themselves.

\subsection{Proposals and analyses of global policy-making}\label{subsec:literature_policies}

\subsubsection{Global carbon pricing}\label{subsubsec:literature_pricing}

Economists generally consider global carbon pricing as the benchmark climate policy, as it would efficiently correct the carbon emissions externality. For example, \citet{hoel_carbon_1991} shows that an international carbon tax can be designed so that it is both efficient and satisfies whatever distributional objectives one might have. 
Concerning the distributional objective, \citet{grubb_greenhouse_1990}, \citet{agarwal_global_1991} and \citet{bertram_tradeable_1992} were the first advocates of an equal right to emit for each human. As \citet{grubb_greenhouse_1990} states it: ``by far the best combination of long term effectiveness, feasibility, equity, and simplicity, is obtained from a system based upon tradable permits for carbon emission which are allocated on an adult per capita basis''. The support for such solution has been renewed ever since \citep{baer_equity_2000,jamieson_climate_2001,blanchard_major_2021,rajan_global_2021}. 

While many endorse the egalitarian allocation of emissions permits, economists also considered this outcome as politically irrealistic. Thus, they tweaked their (integrated assessment) models by assigning more weight to rich countries' interests to preserve the current level of inequalities between countries, precluding any transfer between them \citep{stanton_negishi_2011}. 

\citet{gollier_negotiating_2015} synthesize the distributional decision with a \textit{generosity} parameter which would allocate emissions permit to countries in proportion to their population if set to one, in proportion to their emissions (on the start date of the policy) if set to zero, and as a mixture of the egalitarian and grandfathering rules if set in between. Using a similar formula in the context of a tax, \citet{cramton_international_2015} (summarized in \citealp{mackay_price_2015}) propose that countries around the average emission per capita fix the generosity parameter, so that it is strategically chosen to maximize the tax rate, and to fix the tax rate at the minimum price proposed by participating countries. Negotiations would exclude countries with low ambition beforehand; and the treaty would impose trade sanctions on non-participating countries. %  In \citet{cramton_global_2017}, prominent economists discuss how such negotiations can succeed, and whether a tax or tradable quotas has better chances. The tax is recommended in most chapters (except in the one of Gollier \& Tirole)
\citet{bergh_dual-track_2020} propose a ``dual-track transition to global carbon pricing'': an expanding climate club that would integrate existing and new emissions trading systems, and a reorientation of UNFCCC negotiations towards a global carbon price and burden-sharing rules. 
The \citet{imf_how_2019} also supports global carbon pricing or, as a first step, a carbon price floor. They propose either differentiated prices among countries, or international transfers, and estimate that a price of \$75/tCO$_\text{2}$ in 2030 would be compatible with a 2\textdegree{}C trajectory. %Similarly, \citet{parry_proposal_2021} acknowledges that transfers could be necessary to induce climate action in low- and middle-income countries, though they mention transferring only 1\% of carbon revenues. 

Other authors have advanced more radical ideas. \citet{weitzman_world_2017} envisions a World Climate Assembly with proportional representation at the global scale, so that the median (human) voter would choose the carbon price level. % and each country retaining the revenues TODO?
To finance an adaptation fund, \citet{chancel_carbon_2015} propose a global \textit{progressive} carbon tax (or a progressive tax on air tickets as a first step), so that rich people (who are high emitters) contribute more to the public good. 
\citet{fleurbaey_climate_2013} highlight that, given that current emitters are probably richer than future victims of climate change damages, climate policies deserve a \textit{negative} discount rate. Said differently, we cannot abstract the climate issue from global inequalities, and an ethical response requires global redistribution. 
%* Cramton et al (17): Livre de pontes. Tout le monde est d'accord : un prix mondial du carbone est requis, il ne peut être obtenu que par la réciprocité des engagements (style climate club), et il faut quelques transferts des riches vers les pauvres ainsi que des sanctions commerciales pour aligner les incitations. Ch 4 (also Cramton et al 15) propose la formule suivante de transfert (positif ou négatif) à un fonds climat : générosité*émissions en excès (par rapport à la cible)*prix du carbone. Le livre argumente bcp sur prix vs. quantité (TLM préfère prix sauf Gollier & Tirole), l'argument le plus convaincant en faveur du prix c'est qu'avec la procédure proposée le prix négocié serait le plus élevé possible, alors qu'avec la quantité c'est le budget carbone qui serait le point focal et ça aboutirait à une impasse (objectif trop ambitieux). 
%* Weitzman (17) advocates for a World Climate Assembly, choosing the price level with the median voter, and each country retaining the revenues.
% Fleurbaey & Zuber (13): The discount rate converges to the worst-off (affected by the measure) to the worst-off (beneficiary of the measure) discount rate, which depends on the growth between both agents. Applied to real data, we can consider that the worst-off affected by a global tax on CO_2 is the average-earner on earth (around 75% centile i.e. ~1000€/month, cf. Chancel & Piketty, Lakner & Milanovic, Chakravorty) while the worst-off beneficiary is the worst-off person in the future (among those less affected by CC thanks to the measure), probably below 1000€/month => negative discount rate.

\subsubsection{Climate burden sharing}\label{subsubsec:literature_burden_sharing} 

The literature has discussed different burden-sharing principles. While there is no common agreement on the definitions as different approaches are used (cost sharing, effort sharing or resource sharing, see Section \ref{subsubsec:literature_attitudes_burden_sharing}), we describe here the burden-sharing principles in a consistent manner using the resource sharing approach (i.e. allocating emissions rights). 

\paragraph{Equal per capita.} The simplest one is perhaps to allocate each year's global carbon quota according to an equal right to emit per capita, or an equal right for each adult. Granting an equal right to emit would imply large transfers from high-emitting to low-emitting countries. 

\paragraph{Grandfathering.} On the contrary, \textit{grandfathering} would grant emissions rights in proportion to current emissions. From the perspective of allocating carbon pricing revenues between countries, grandfathering amounts to each country retaining the revenues it collects. Given that nations are sovereign and have not agreed to share emissions rights, this principle can be considered as the default option to which the other ones can be compared, in terms of distributive effects.

\paragraph{Historical responsibilities.} At the opposite side of the spectrum is \textit{historical responsibilities}, which grants to countries a carbon budget proportional to their population. Countries that have emitted more than average have accumulated a carbon debt towards countries that have emitted less, which have a carbon credit.\footnote{It is not clear how these debts would be settled. Perhaps using a conventional social cost of carbon to monetize them, by crediting (positively or negatively) emissions rights to countries in an international carbon market, or by means of carbon removal from the atmosphere.} 

To fully specify this rule, one needs to define a start date for the responsibilities on past emissions, and to specify how the population size is accounted for. 1990 is often chosen as a start year as it is the date of the first IPCC assessment report and climate change was widely acknowledged around that time, though variants include 1972, 1960, 1950 or 1850.\footnote{\href{https://climateequitymonitor.in}{Climate equity monitor} uses 1850 for example.} Several solutions have been proposed to account for evolving populations, none of which is perfect. \citet{matthews_quantifying_2015} allocates emissions rights on a given year proportionally to the countries' populations in that year. An alternative is to use fixed populations, chosen either as the start year populations \citep{neumayer_defence_2000}, or at a future date like projections of populations when the global total will reach 9 billion \citep{raupach_sharing_2014}. 

The rationale for using fixed populations is to avoid the incentive for a country to grow its population to obtain more rights to emit. However, this solution treats similarly countries with different demographic trajectories, effectively penalizing countries which grow more than others (if past populations are used) or grow more than expected (if future populations are used). Using current populations like \citet{matthews_quantifying_2015} also comes with its own problems. Think of two countries having contributed very little to cumulative emissions, with the same emissions per capita but different demography: country A's population has doubled in the last 30 years while country B's has remained stable. Country B will have accumulated more carbon credit than country A, despite a similar situation in the present. In effect, compensating country B more because it was more populous in the past amounts to compensating the deads although it is future generations who will suffer. That being said, using current populations is probably a better solution than using fixed populations as in practice, demographic trajectories of countries with similar emissions per capita are not too far apart. 

\paragraph{Ability to pay.} Another prominent burden-sharing principle is the ability to pay: richer countries should contribute more to mitigation efforts. To operationalize this principle, \citet{baer_greenhouse_2008} define \textit{capacity} as the share of global income above an exemption threshold. They use the threshold of \$7,500 per year (in 2005 PPP), which corresponds to the top 28\% of the global income distribution. According to this principle, the effort of a country should be proportional to the revenues it would raise with a linear income tax on individual income above \$7,500. 

% \paragraph{Greenhouse Development Rights.} 
\paragraph{Climate Equity Reference Framework} \citet{baer_greenhouse_2008} %actually 
propose another effort-sharing method, %originally 
%dubbed the \textit{greenhouse development rights} (GDR)
%but now renamed 
the \textit{Climate Equity Reference Framework} (CERF), which blends the ability to pay with their version of historical responsibilities. They define \textit{responsibility} as follows: they determine the mitigation requirement as the emissions gap between the Business as Usual scenario from \citet{iea_world_2007} and a 2\textdegree{}C (with 68-86\% probability) scenario. They then allocate the mitigation requirement to countries in proportion to their cumulative emissions (starting in 1990). The emissions rights of a country according to their \textit{responsibility} is then given by its Business as Usual emissions minus its mitigation requirement. An country's emissions right, dubbed its \textit{greenhouse development right} (GDR), 
%The GDR of a country 
is defined similarly, except that a blend of \textit{capacity} (C) and \textit{responsibility} (R) is used to allocate the mitigation requirement between countries. This allocation key is called the \textit{Responsibility and Capacity Indicator} (RCI) and defined as $RCI = R^{a}\cdot C^{1-a}$, with $a=.4$. % TODO! canonical article is Holz et al 18

This choice of parameter appears somewhat arbitrary, but the \href{https://climateequityreference.org}{EcoEquity calculator} allows to customize all CERF %GDR 
parameters \citep{holz_climate_2019}. The Climate Action Network chose to adopt the CERF %GDR 
as its \textit{fair share} framework, though the different national chapters of the organization could not agree on a choice of parameters \citep{athanasiou_fair_2022}.% This paper is one of the best to read in this subsection
\footnote{The \href{https://usfairshare.org/}{U.S. Climate Action Network} and the think tank \href{https://www.ecoequity.org/about/}{EcoEquity} (funded by Tom Athanasiou and late Paul Baer) choose the following parameters: an equal weight for R and C ($a=.5$), their own \href{https://climateequityreference.org/calculator-information/gdp-and-emissions-baselines/}{business as usual projections} of CO$_\text{2}$ emissions based on trends of GDP growth and emissions intensity reduction,  % Given all this, our strategy is a modest one. As we mention above and explain in greater detail below, our algorithm for projecting CO2 emissions is based on combining estimates of emissions intensity reduction with estimates of GDP growth, with the values for both derived from a convergence from historical rates of change to projected long-term (through 2030) rates of change. To limit the influence of climate policies, we have elected to utilize the rates of change for GDP and emissions intensity from a set of baseline scenarios that are included in the scenario database of the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment report (the baseline scenarios of the EMF27 modelling exercise, to be precise)
a 1.5\textdegree{}C (Low Energy Demand) pathway, 1950 as the start year for responsibility, a gradual inclusion of income to compute \textit{capacity} (complexifying the above) from a full exemption of the bottom 70\% (\$7,500 per year) linearly to a full inclusion of the top 2\% (\$72,211), the inclusion of non-CO$_\text{2}$ gases but not of emissions embodied in trade (i.e. imported emissions) nor LULUCF (land-use). }

The CERF %GDR 
approach was adopted by a prominent network of climate NGOs because it operationalize the principle of \textit{common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities} recognized by the UNFCCC. However, this approach suffers from three important limitations. First, its definition of historical responsibility as an effort sharing principle is inconsistent with the principle of an equal right of cumulative emissions per capita, which is a resource sharing principle. Indeed, imagine a country that is fully decarbonized and has exhausted \textit{exactly} its cumulative carbon budget. Because it developed before the others, it has relatively high cumulative emissions, hence must highly contribute to mitigation effort according to the CERF %GDR 
notion of \textit{responsibility}. Yet, according to the usual definition based on an equal right of cumulative emissions p.c., the historical responsibility approach should leave this country with no liability as it has not exceeded its carbon budget. 
Second, a country with moderate incomes\footnote{Using the above parameters, moderate incomes means few income above the global 70th. percentile.} and low historical responsibility would have a relatively low effort, even if its emissions per capita are high. In other words, the CERF %GDR 
approach favors countries which have experienced recent growth. % , like China
Third, the poorest countries would be granted emissions rights close to the Business as Usual trajectory, as they would bear virtually none of the effort. But this trajectory carries the current (unfair) income distribution and amounts to grandfathering. As an example, the DRC's baseline trajectory for emissions\footnote{The baseline trajectory is computed as the ``product of the projected GDP and CO$_\text{2}$ emission intensity''.} is 0.8 tCO$_\text{2}$ p.c. in 2030, %(this is 16\% more than in 2020, but a lot lower than the global objective of about 4t). 
which is five times less than the world average emissions right per capita. Should the DRC grow faster than projected in the baseline, then under this framework it would actually have to pay to the rest of the world for mitigation efforts. This is what is likely to happen to countries like Mexico or Senegal, from our simulation of the net gains of CERF compared to a situation without international transfers (see Figure \ref{fig:gain_gdr_over_gdp_2030}). 
Conversely, in a resource sharing approach like the equal per capita one, low-income countries would receive emissions rights in excess of their projected trajectory, which could translate into transfers coming from high-income countries. By construction, such transfers do not occur in an effort sharing approach like the CERF. %GDR. 
Compared to an equal right to emit per capita, this method favors countries like China (whose emissions are allowed to remain stable over 2020-2030 instead of a reduction by 35-40\%) and penalizes regions like Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America (see Figure \ref{fig:diff_gain_gdr_gcs_over_gdp_2030}).

\end{figure} % TODO? GDR -> CERF in figure?

\paragraph{Contraction and Convergence.} \citet{meyer_briefing_2004} defines a blend of grandfathering and equal per capita called contraction and convergence (C\&C). This rule grants (tradable) emissions rights to each country, starting at their current emission level and converging linearly to an equal per capita level at some pre-specified date. The \textit{contraction} part comes from the reduction of total emissions rights in line with the climate objective. When discussed around year 2000, the convergence date was specified between 2020 and 2050. This rule, advocated by the Global Commons Institute (a UK think tank), was on the agenda from COP2 to COP15 (in Copenhagen), including at Kyoto, and endorsed by the European Parliament in 1998. More recently, \citet{gignac_allocating_2015} show how C\&C can be made consistent with historical responsibilities, by computing carbon debts and credits until the date of convergence.

\paragraph{Assessments of the NDCs against burden-sharing principles.} 
The regime established by the 2015 Paris agreement to regulate climate change respects none of the burden-sharing principles, and relies instead on voluntary contributions of each country, known as the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Therefore, a literature (reviewed by \citealp{hohne_regional_2014}) assesses the NDCs against the emissions reduction objective and different burden-sharing principles. \citet{gao_sufficient_2019} expresses the NDCs in terms of emissions in 2030 and infers the rise in temperature implied by the NDCs. \citet{van_den_berg_implications_2020} is the most recent and complete assessment of NDCs against burden-sharing principles (see also \citealp{robiou_du_pont_national_2016,robiou_du_pont_equitable_2017,raupach_sharing_2014}).

\subsubsection{Global redistribution}\label{subsubsec:literature_redistribution}
% TODO? Give a stat on income disparities between countries?
% SDG, need for int'l transfers
Addressing global poverty, inequalities and climate change are at the heart of the universally agreed Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). % 12 out of  17
\citet{bolch_arithmetics_2022} have pointed out that low-income countries generally do not have enough domestic resources to eliminate their poverty gap in the short run. %In other words, it would hardly be possible to achieve the first SDG and end extreme poverty by 2030 without international transfers. % Zhang (16) estimates the poverty gap in each country. Global one is at $80G/year.
This shows that international transfers would be needed to rapidly end global poverty. 
%The lack of solidarity from high-income countries has been long criticized. 
In \textit{Beyond the Welfare State}, Gunnar \citet{myrdal_beyond_1960} called for a \textit{welfare world}. He used his Nobel lecture to recommend an increase of foreign aid to low-income countries as ``The type of marginal foreign aid we have provided, is clearly not enough to meet their barest needs'' \citep{myrdal_equality_1975}.

% Unequal exchange, Hickel
Following the labor theory of value, a strand of economists have argued that global inequalities stem from unequal exchange in international trade \citep{arghiri_unequal_1972}. Indeed, the stark disparity in wages between countries implies that one unit of labor exported by an American commands five units of labor embodied in goods imported to the U.S., while Ethiopians need to export 50 units of labor to get one in their imports \citep{alsamawi_employment_2014,reyes_better_2017}.
Taking stock, \citet{hickel_divide_2017} proposes to globally establish minimum wages at 50\% of the local median wage. \citet{hickel_divide_2017} also suggests other solutions against global inequality, which inspired our questionnaire: cancellation of low-income countries' public debt, fair trade (in particular no tariffs from high-income countries, reduced patent protections, reduced farming subsidies in rich countries), measures against tax evasion (e.g. a global financial register), land reform, and a fair international climate policy. 

\citet{piketty_capital_2014} prominently defends a progressive wealth tax at the global level, though he did not specify whether the revenues should fund international transfers. %how the revenues should be used, nor whether there should fund international transfers.% and it was implicit that each country would retain the revenues it collected. 

% Unfairness of current tax rates
\citet{kopczuk_limitations_2005} compute the optimal linear income tax rates for all countries in two ways: globally centralized and decentralized (i.e. in each country, without international transfers). They show that the average decentralized rate is 41\%. The global one 62\%, which would finance a basic income of 250\$/month (higher than 73 countries' GDP per capita). From a current global Gini index of 0.695, they show that decentralized optimal taxation would barely reduce global inequality to 0.69, while global taxation would bring the Gini down to 0.25. Current foreign aid can only be rationalized if the U.S. attaches 2,000 less value to a citizen in poorest countries than to an American (or 1,000 less if half of the transfers are diverted due to corruption).

\subsubsection{Basic income}\label{subsubsec:literature_basic_income}

Unconditional cash transfers (UCT) are increasingly seen as an effective way to end extreme poverty. Indeed, positive results from randomized controlled trials are accumulating: \citet{gangopadhyay_cash_2015} find that UCT outperform a food subsidy; \citet{haushofer_short-term_2016} find significant impacts on health, economic outcomes, and psychological well-being; \citet{egger_general_2022} find large positive spillovers on non-recipient people, and minimal inflation. 
Reviews of extant research confirm the positive outcomes of UCT \citep{standing_little_2014,bastagli_cash_2016}.

Although delivering cash to remote places and avoiding fraud is challenging in regions without a proper civil register, mobile phones could be used as tools for banking and biometric identification \citep{harnett_taking_2017}. While many places are still lacking internet access, progress is rapid in satellite internet access, and some argue that it could soon become cheap and ubiquitous \citep{hanson_satellite_2016}.

\subsubsection{Global democracy}\label{subsubsec:literature_democracy}

The idea of world federalism follows a long tradition, dating back at least to \citet{kant_zum_1795}, who argued that this was the necessary condition for perpetual peace. 
International organizations were eventually created to foster peace, though the League of Nations and its successor, the United Nations, never succeeded in avoiding military conflicts. 
Many have argued that we need stronger and more democratic global institutions, competent to address global challenges like extreme poverty, climate change, wars, pandemics, or financial stability. 
Before World War II, feminist and pacifist \citet{maverick_lloyd_chaos_1937} founded the \textit{Campaign for World Government}, defending direct representation at the global scale. 
\citet{einstein_general_1947} called for the subordination of the UN Security Council to the General Assembly, and the direct election of UN delegates. 
Since 2007, individuals and institutions from more than 150 countries have endorsed the appeal for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly (UNPA), including 1,800 member of parliament, heads of state, as well the European Parliament, the Pan-African Parliament, and the Latin-American Parliament. The UNPA calls for a gradual implementation of a democratic assembly, starting with a consultative assembly composed of members of national parliaments, allowing for the direction election of its members in voluntary countries, and evolving toward a world parliament able to adopt binding regulations once all members are directly elected \citep{leinen_world_2018}. % READ Ch 13, 21, 22, 26
Besides the UNPA, various scholars have proposed different models of global democracy, ranging from deliberative spaces to a world federation \citep{archibugi_global_2011}. % TODO READ and expand, also read marchetti_global_2008
%Using surveys covering 86\% of global population, \citet{hale_could_2019} find that the world as a whole is less polarized that some countries and argue against the fear people's views would be too diverse for a functioning global democracy. 
While the most radical proposals are still out of sight, an assembly of random citizens representative of the world population has already been convened. It has produced a joint statement at the COP26 \citep{global_assembly_report_2022}, and a similar \textit{World Citizens' Assembly} should soon follow.

On demanderait aux États autour de la moyenne d'émission de fixer ce paramètre de générosité, pour qu'il soit fixé de sorte à maximiser le prix, puis on fixerait le prix comme le prix minimum proposé (après avoir éjecté qqs pays récalcitrants des négos). Puis, sanctions commerciales pour ceux qui ne respectent pas le prix.

Le livre argumente bcp sur prix vs. quantité (TLM préfère prix sauf Gollier & Tirole), l'argument le plus convaincant en faveur du prix c'est qu'avec la procédure proposée le prix négocié serait le plus élevé possible, alors qu'avec la quantité c'est le budget carbone qui serait le point focal et ça aboutirait à une impasse (objectif trop ambitieux).

%*? Milner & Tingley (13): (highly cited but no original data, don't think we need to cite it) In 2008, 44% of American wanted foreign aid cut (american elections study, 08). fraction of federal budget going to foreign aid (mean: 27%, median: 25%) / should go (mean: 13%, median: 10%) (WorldPublicOpinion, 10)
% PIPA (01): Overwhelming majorities support a multilateral effort to cut hunger in half by the year 2015 and say that they would be willing to pay for the costs of such a program. However, most do not think that the average American would be as willing to pay the necessary costs. when PIPA asked respondents to estimate how much of the federal budget was devoted to foreign aid, the median estimate was 15% -- 15 times the actual amount, which was just under 1%. More dramatically, when asked what an appropriate percentage would be, the median response was 5% -- 5 times the actual amount. And when asked to imagine that they heard the real amount was only 1%, only 18% of respondents said they thought that would be too much--as compared to the 75% who had initially said that the US was spending too much. what percentage of their "tax dollars that go to help poor people at home and abroad...should go to help poor people in other countries." The mean response was 16% (down a bit from 22% in response to this question in a 1996 PIPA poll). Strikingly, this turns out to be a far higher percentage than is currently given. In 1999, a bit less than 4% of the total spent on the poor went to the poor abroad. Sixty percent of respondents proposed a percentage that was higher than 4%.

(…) The per person cost of meeting MDG1 came to £25 for the UK, $56 for the US, €27 for Germany, and so on. On average 77 per cent of respondents are in favour of contributing towards meeting the goal (provided that all others do too). To take the US example, 75 per cent of people supported paying an extra $56 per year to meet MDG1. What is significant about this figure is that it is only slightly below the support for the ‘cost free’ question as to whether the US should be willing to share a  small portion of its wealth with those who are in great need (79%).” Hudson & van Heerde (12)

For example, in the UK, 47 per cent of respondents thought that aid was wasted, with sizable majorities citing corruption and poor management and/or delivery as primary factors (DFID, 2008). More disconcertingly, US respondents thought that only 23 per cent of US aid money that goes to poor countries ends up helping the people who really need it and 54 per cent of US aid money that goes to poor countries ends up in the pockets of corrupt government officials (PIPA, 2001).

Effort-sharing approach based on splitting emissions reductions in function of capacity to pay (~ share of global income in top 30%) and responsibility (share of emissions since 1950), weighted equally. Corresponds to UNFCCC wording. Pb of this method (applying to any choice of parameters): A country with relatively low incomes (e.g. equal distribution slightly above the p70) and that has few historical responsibility would have a relatively low effort. Even more problematic, the **poorest countries would have virtually 0% of the effort, hence they would be allowed to emit following the baseline trajectory… but this baseline is not fair; it amounts to grandfathering**. It is computed as the “product of the projected GDP and CO2 emission intensity”. ([https://climateequityreference.org/calculator-information/gdp-and-emissions-baselines/](https://climateequityreference.org/calculator-information/gdp-and-emissions-baselines/)), and give for example 0.8tCO2e/cap for RDC in 2030 (16% more than in 2020, but lot lower than the objective of ~4t). => Compared to an equal right to emit pc, this method favors countries like China (allowed to remain stable over 2020-30 vs. reduced by 35-40%) and penalizes countries like the U.S. and Africa. 
%  in Athanasiou et al (22) Justification of Greenhouse Development Rights instead of Equal per capita right is on p. 36. It is weak, and basically that historical responsibility should be taken into account. Conversely, justification against historical resp. is that the latter doesn’t take into account capacity to pay (it is not said like this, but we can think of ex-USSR).

These scenarios have global 2030 emissions targets of 11%–43% below 2010, global net negativeCO2 emissions starting between 2056 and 2080 … G7 members’ Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDCs) mitigation targets are in line with a grandfathering approach but lack ambition to meet various visions of climate justice. The INDCs of China and Russia fall short of meeting the requirements of any allocation approach. Depending on how their INDCs are evaluated, the INDCs of India and Brazil can match some equity approaches evaluated in this study.

% Different framing of burden-sharing, depending on what should be split:
% - mitigation costs: this is the most used as it is easiest to explain. The issue is that it is not specified how agents pay (or if some agents receive payments) and implicitly, there is no negative costs (transfers exceeding the costs) and the carbon price is not uniform. Used in .
% - emission: this one is vague as it doesn't state at which date emissions pc converge (if they do) and whether there are side payments.
% - emission rights: this one is the most accurate as there is no need of a BAU scenario to compute the mitigation needed and its cost.

% Different fairness principles:
% - equal emission right per capita: using this as a baseline, we can call 'grandfathering' any principle that is more regressive and 'historical responsibility' any principle that is more progressive
% - equal emission reduction (in share of current emission) per capita: grandfathering
% - emission rights proportional to current emissions: grandfathering
% - costs proportional to current emissions: polluter-pay principle
% - costs proportional to cumulative emissions: so-called historical responsibility but may actually have a grandfathering component

% Surveys of population:
% - Schleich et al. (Climate Policy, 16) ask for ranking and find an identical ranking of fairness principles in China, Germany, and the US: accountability (costs according to emissions) followed by capability (according to economic strength), egalitarianism (equal emission per capita), and sovereignty (constant share of global emission) (see Lange & Schiwplies (17) for the computations). 
%   Polluter-pays: Every country has to bear costs according to the emissions it causes (hence countries causing higher emissions have a higher share of the costs).
%   Ability-to-pay: Every country has to bear costs according to its economic strength (hence richer countries have a higher share of the costs).
%   Egalitarian: Every country is allowed to produce the same amount of emissions per capita (hence countries with currently high emissions per capita have higher costs).
%   Sovereignty: Every country is allowed to produce the same share of global emissions as in the past (hence the proportional reduction of emissions is the same for every country).
% other findings: international agreements are important but current ones are unsuccessful, people find themselves poorly represented in climate negotiations
% - Bechtel & Scheve (PNAS, 13) find with a conjoint analysis on FR, DE, UK, US that a climate agreement is 5 p.p. less likely to be preferred (to a random alternative) if only rich countries pay (other burden-sharing are: pay prop. to current emissions / historical emissions / rich countries pay more than poor countries) and 15 p.p. more likely to be preferred if it includes 160 (out of 192) countries rather than 20 => confirms preference for global policies (rather than only partial coverage). Finds that costs is what matters most: preference decreases by 30pp if it’s 2.5% of GDP compared to 0.5%.
% - Carlsson et al. (REE, 13) find using a 09 choice experiment that Americans prefer capacity to pay > current responsibility > historical responsibility > equal emissions per capita while Chinese prefer historical > capacity > current > equal emissions.
%   Capacity to pay: Countries with high income levels must pay a larger share of the costs than countries with low income levels. This option says that countries with greater ability to pay should pay more
%   Current responsibility: Countries with currently high emissions levels must pay a larger share of the costs than countries with currently low emissions levels. This option says that those countries that are currently a larger part of the problem should pay more.
%   Historical responsibility: Countries with a history of high emissions levels must pay a larger share of the costs than countries with a history of lower emissions. This option recognizes that CO2 builds up in the atmosphere over many years. Thus, countries with a history of high emissions should pay more because they caused more of the problem.
%   Equal emissions pc: Countries with emissions per person greater than an agreed amount must pay, and they must pay more the higher their emissions per person area.
% > "equal emissions" is a misnomer as this is about costs (not emissions) and it's just a more progressive version of current responsibility / polluter-pay, where high-emitting pay more and low-emitting don't pay. The result for US is compatible with the other papers as Americans agree that rich countries (or high-emitting, the diff is small) should pay more. The Chinese position could also be reconciliable once we define responsibility from footprint rather than territorial and that there will be transfers from rich to poor countries.
% - Carlsson et al. (Ecol Eco, 11) find that Swedes prefer that "all countries are allowed to emit an equal amount per capita" rather than options where emissions reduce in relation to current or historical emissions and continue to be higher in high-emitting countries. 
% - Meilland et al. (23) find that in US and France, most favored fairness principle is Equality in per capita emissions: "all countries commit to converge to the same average of total emissions per inhabitant, compatible with a controlled climate change" and second-most (which closely follows) is grandfathering: "all countries commit to reduce their emissions by a same proportion". 73% in each disagree with grandfathering when defined as "countries which emitted a lot of carbon in the past have a right to continue emitting more than others in the future". To rationalize these contrasted views with grandfathering, we can interpret them as: equal rights, equal emission reductions, and transfers. 
%   convergence per capita (70%): all countries commit to converge to the same average of total emissions per inhabitant, compatible with a controlled climate change
%   grandfathering (60%): all countries commit to reduce their emissions by a same proportion
%   past emissions (20% choose it among their two favorite): countries which emitted less in the past commit to reduce their emissions less than other countries
%   poor countries (20%): poorer countries commit to reduce their emissions less than richer countries
%   cost-efficiency (20%): countries where reducing emissions is more costly commit to reduce their emissions less than other countries
% Other findings: people prefer international settlement on CC even if it empedes on sovereignty, a majority prefers to target footprint rather than territorial emissions, median is that countries should be held accountable for post-1990 emissions, self-serving bias when judging e.g. India vs. EU, no shared understanding of fairness when asked to coordinate between French and Americans
% - Dechezleprêtre et al. (WP, 22) find that equal per capita right > historical responsability, capabilities > grandfathering; that global CC policies are needed; 50% support for global T&D; strong support for global tax on millionaires; no free-riding. 
% - Dabla-Norris et al. (WP, 23) find strong majority for “all countries” everywhere in “Which countries do you think should be paying to reduce carbon emissions?”, and majority for current rather than historical in all countries but China and Saudi Arabia in “Should countries be paying to reduce carbon emissions based on their current or accumulated historic levels of emissions?”

% > Position making all this compatible: people want that every country engage in strong decarbonization effort together, with a global quota, converging to climate neutrality in the medium run, based on an equal right to emit per person, implying that rich countries pay and low-emitting countries receive funding. Where the rankings differ, it is likely because the definitions or wordings are different, and also because it involves different countries (Sweden != US != China).
% - Schleich find support for costs according to emissions and against immediate equalization of emissions (but nothing against convergence to equal emissions per capita).
% - This is just in contradiction with Carlsson (11) which finds that Swedes prefer the equalization (with a similar wording) to other reduction options. 
% - Bechtel find agreement that rich countries should pay more and historical emissions matter, but just that they should not be the only one to make the efforts. 
% - Carlsson (13) find that the least preferred option in China and US is when low-emitting countries don't participate to the effort. Ability to pay is liked in both countries.
% - Meilland find that convergence is the most preferred, followed by emission reductions of same proportion, disagreement with grandfathering expressed in terms of emission rights.
% - Dechezleprêtre find support for equal right is strongest, although historical responsibility and capabilities are also supported. The quota system is strongly supported.
