% \noindent \cite{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022-1} %Using new surveys on more than 40,000 respondents in twenty countries that account for 72\% of global CO$_\text{2}$ emissions, we study the understanding of and attitudes toward climate change and climate policies. We show that, across countries, support for climate policies hinges on three key perceptions centered around the effectiveness of the policies in reducing emissions (effectiveness concerns), their distributional impacts on lower-income households (inequality concerns), and their impact on the respondents' household (self-interest). We show experimentally that information  specifically addressing these key concerns can substantially increase the support for climate policies in many countries. Explaining how policies work and who can benefit from them is critical to foster policy support, whereas simply informing people about the impacts of climate change is not effective. Furthermore, we identify several socioeconomic and lifestyle factors -- most notably education, political leanings, and availability of public transportation -- that are significantly correlated with both policy views and overall reasoning and beliefs about climate policies. However, it is difficult to predict beliefs or policy views based on these characteristics only.

\begin{document}

% Nature guidelines (not NCC!)
% Sections can only be used in Articles.  Contributions should be organized in the sequence: title, text, methods, references, Supplementary Information line (if any), acknowledgements, interest declaration, corresponding author line, tables, figure legends.

% Spelling must be British English (Oxford English Dictionary)

%Each figure legend should begin with a brief title for the whole figure and continue with a short description of each panel and the symbols used. For contributions with methods sections, legends should not contain any details of methods, or exceed 100 words (fewer than 500 words in total for the whole paper). In contributions without methods sections, legends should be fewer than 300 words (800 words or fewer in total for the whole paper).

% Articles are restricted to 50 references,

% In addition, a cover letter needs to be written with the
% following:
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item A 100 word or less summary indicating on scientific grounds
% why the paper should be considered for a wide-ranging journal like
% \textsl{Nature} instead of a more narrowly focussed journal.
%  \item A 100 word or less summary aimed at a non-scientific audience,
% written at the level of a national newspaper.  It may be used for
% \textsl{Nature}'s press release or other general publicity.
%  \item The cover letter should state clearly what is included as the
% submission, including number of figures, supporting manuscripts
% and any Supplementary Information (specifying number of items and
% format).
%  \item The cover letter should also state the number of
% words of text in the paper; the number of figures and parts of
% figures (for example, 4 figures, comprising 16 separate panels in
% total); a rough estimate of the desired final size of figures in
% terms of number of pages; and a full current postal address,
% telephone and fax numbers, and current e-mail address.
% \end{enumerate}

% See \textsl{Nature}'s website

\section*{Results}
% % 4 most important figures: heatmap OECD, heatmap support, prioritization or conjoint (r), list exp (table)
% H0: Majority support for each global policies except maximum wealth and debt cancellation
% H0: Foreign aid: less than 20\% want a decrease (because nationalist), median wants increase at some conditions (no diversion, human rights) => GCS mostly addresses these points
% H1: List experiment: There seems to be a 8pp social norm (differential of 3pp with NR). No effect of the number of options. TODO: check litterature
% H1: Petition: Small effect against GCS: -4pp
% H1, H2: Conjoint analysis: G|C+R 56%, G|R 59%, G 48% ~ C (|R), G+C|R 56%, C|R 64%, Left+G - Left = -3pp, A+G vs. B 59%
% => G is supported for itself, rather independently from R or C, with similar support to both, and it doesn't significantly penalize the Left, and would help a Democratic candidate
% H1: Prioritization: G has mean only slightly lower than average, makes better than ban of cars and coal exit; global tax on millionaires does as well as wealth tax and almost as good as $15 minimum wage
% H3 belief: No pluralistic ignorance
% H4: A strong majority is universalist/cosmopolitan (TODO: which word?), even a majority for non-Republican

\begin{methods}
%Put methods in here.  If you are going to subsection it, use \subsection commands.  Methods section should be less than 800 words and if it is less than 200 words, it can be incorporated into the main text.

% \subsection{Method subsection.}

% Here is a description of a specific method used.  Note that the subsection heading ends with a full stop (period) and that the command is \verb|\subsection{}| not \verb|\subsection*{}|.
