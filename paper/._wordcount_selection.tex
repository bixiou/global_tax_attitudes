A 2\% tax on wealth in excess of \$5 million would raise \$816 billion each year, that is 0.85\% of the Gross World Product (GWP), half of it coming from the U.S. and less than \$1 billion from all low-income countries (28 countries home to 700 million people) combined. This tax schedule is just a basic example of what a small wealth tax can raise: let us call it the ``basic'' tax schedule. \citet{chancel_world_2022} offers a \href{https://wid.world/world-wealth-tax-simulator/}{world wealth tax simulator} that allows estimating the revenues of a custom global wealth tax by world region.\footnote{Similar simulators exist for \href{https://taxjusticenow.org/}{the U.S.} \citep{saez_triumph_2019} and \href{http://taxsimulator.ukwealth.tax/#/appendix}{the UK} while \citet{kapeller_european_2021} and \citet{oxfam_taxing_2022} offer similar estimates for the EU and many countries, respectively. Despite differences in some assumptions and the data used, all these simulators and calculations yield comparable estimates.}
