While action at a global level reduces tax avoidance, taxing wealth at the national level already significantly makes a dent on inequality and generates important revenues. 
The implementation of national wealth taxes should therefore not be delayed by the wait of a global wealth tax. 
We call like-minded political parties of all countries to include a wealth tax proposal in their platform, and implement it when they arrive in power. We propose below a design of wealth tax that can be replicated in any country so that national wealth taxes would be compatible and part of a global wealth tax system.
