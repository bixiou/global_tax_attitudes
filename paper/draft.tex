  A global carbon price funding a global basic income, called the ``Global Climate Scheme'' (GCS), would be an effective and progressive way to combat climate change and poverty. Yet, such policy is mostly absent from political platforms and the policy debate. 
  Using surveys on 40,680 respondents in 20 countries covering 72\% of global CO$_\text{2}$ emissions, we document majority support for this and other global policies. Using a complementary survey on 8,000 respondents in the U.S., France, Germany, Spain and the UK, we test several hypotheses that could reconcile strong stated support with a lack of salience of these issues. The complementary analyses show that the stated support is mostly sincere, as a list experiment shows no evidence of social desirability bias, majorities are also willing to sign a real-stake petition, and global redistributive policies rank high %(though not highest) 
  in the prioritization of policies. Conjoint analyses reveal that a progressive candidate would not significantly lose voting share by endorsing the GCS in any country, and may even gain 11 p.p. %in voting intention 
  in France. Likewise, a platform is more likely to be preferred if it contains the GCS or a global tax on millionaires. 
  Accurate beliefs about the level of support for the GCS dismisses the hypothesis of pluralistic ignorance of the support. 
  Strong universalistic attitudes are confirmed in more general questions, suggesting that the support cannot be explained away by malleable opinion or experimenter demand. In sum, our findings indicate that global policies are genuinely supported by a majority of the population. Public opinion is therefore not the reason that they do not prominently enter political debates. %Finally, we conclude that, at odds with the absence of global policies in the public debate or political platforms, there is no evidence that most people would reject them. %there is no compelling reason why global policies do not enter the public debate or political platforms, as they seem genuinely supported by a majority of the population.

% TD change the intro, e.g. Global poverty and climate change are among the most critical issues faced by the world today", and then explain that the first could be solved by transfer, the second by capping pollution, hence an effective policy to tackle these two problems is the GCS. Yet, this policy is nowhere to be seen in policy debates. Why? In this paper we provide evidence from surveys showing that people all over the world support this policy. To explain this paradox (people stated support vs absence of the policy), we further investigate the sincerity of these claims and rationales behind the support, etc.

Extreme poverty and climate change are among the most critical issues of our time. The first could be solved by redistributive transfers, the second by capping global emissions. %Indeed, transfers from high- to low-income countries are warranted by widespread ethical theories like utilitarianism,\cite{mill_utilitarianism_1861}.  
A fair and effective policy to tackle these two problems is the ``Global Climate Scheme'' (GCS), which combines these two solutions. The GCS consists of a global cap-and-trade system, where emission rights are auctioned each year to polluting firms, and of a global basic income, funded by the auction revenues. 
% I have added the following lines. TODO? put in a footnote?
Using the price and emissions trajectories from the report by \cite{stern_report_2017}, %Stern-Stiglitz report,\cite{stern_report_2017} 
we estimate that the basic income would amount to \$30 per month for each human above 15 in 2030, enough to lift out of extreme poverty the 700 million people who live with less than PPP \$2 per day. Conversely, assuming a carbon price of \$90/tCO$_\text{2}$ in 2030, high emitters like a typical American (with median U.S. CO$_\text{2}$ emissions) would lose in net \$85 per month, as they would face \$115 per month in price increases (see details in Appendix \ref{app:gain_gcs}). 

Extreme poverty is parallel to global inequality, as the GDP per capita (in 2021, in purchasing power parity) is 26 times larger in high-income countries (home to 1.2 billion people) than in low-income countries (700 million), 59 times larger in the U.S. than in the DRC, and 172 times larger in Luxembourg than in Burundi. A global 2\% tax on individual wealth in excess of \$5 million would collect \$816 billion every year, leaving unaffected 99.9\% of people.\footnote{Figures come from \citet{chancel_world_2022}, the \href{https://wid.world/world-wealth-tax-simulator/}{WID wealth tax simulator}, and the World Bank.} If 35\% of these potential revenues were allocated to low-income countries, their national income would increase by 50\%. % https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=XD-XM

% On top of addressing both global poverty and climate change, we provide evidence from surveys showing that people all over the world support this policy. Yet, the GCS is nowhere to be seen in policy debates. Why? To explain this paradox (absence of the policy despite majority stated support), we further investigate rationales behind the support for the GCS and the sincerity of these claims, as well as attitudes toward other global policies, global redistribution, and universalistic values. % TODO: rework

In this paper, we study attitudes toward global policies that address climate change, global poverty or inequalities, with a focus on the GCS. Using an international survey on climate attitudes, we document majority support for global policies like the GCS and a global millionaire tax in 20 among the largest countriest. Yet, such global policies are nowhere to be seen in policy debates. Why? To explain this paradox (absence of the policy despite majority stated support), we run complementary surveys on 8,000 American and European respondents and test different hypotheses: insincerity of support for the GCS, pluralistic ignorance (i.e. false belief that most do not support it), defavorable electoral outcomes for a candidate that would support it, or low priority given to global issues. Furthermore, we also study attitudes toward other global policies, global redistribution, and universalistic values.

\paragraph{Literature.} The literature review is relegated to Appendix \ref{sec:literature}. It includes references to the few other attitudinal surveys on global policies (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_attitudes_policies}); a critical review of the literature on attitudes toward climate burden sharing (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_attitudes_burden_sharing}); references to the large literature on attitudes toward foreign aid (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_foreign_aid}); and introduction to the literatures on global carbon pricing (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_pricing}), global redistribution (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_redistribution}), basic income (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_basic_income}), and global democracy (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_democracy}). 
% Ethical theories often warrant transfers from high- to low-income people, hence from high- to low-income countries. This is the case of utilitarianism, the benchmark ethical theory used in economics. Utilitarianism assigns the same weight to each person and thus considers that a dollar is better allocated to a low-income person, which has a higher marginal utility than a high-income person.\cite{mill_utilitarianism_1861} 

% Addressing global poverty, inequalities and climate change are at the heart of the universally agreed Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). % 12 out of  17
% It has been pointed out that low-income countries generally do not have enough domestic resources to eliminate the poverty gap in the short run.\cite{bolch_arithmetics_2022} % In other words, it would hardly be possible to achieve the first SDG and end extreme poverty by 2030 without international transfers. => Careful, Bolch use a poverty line above the SDG one.

% Climate change is another issue that calls for a global response and in particular international transfers. Postulating %Assuming
% that each human has an equal right to emit CO$_\text{2}$, low emitters have a legitimate claim \textit{vis-à-vis} high emitters, that can be settled by monetary transfers. Coupling this burden-sharing principle to the carbon budget (remaining emissions that would be compatible with the Paris agreement) naturally defines a global climate policy. We call it the ``Global climate scheme'' (GCS); it consists of a global cap-and-trade system where emission rights are auctioned each year to polluting firms and the revenues finance a global basic income. Using the price and emissions trajectories from the Stern-Stiglitz report,\cite{stern_report_2017} we estimate that the basic income would amount to \$30 per month for each human above 15 in 2030, enough to lift out of extreme poverty the 700 million people who live with less than PPP \$2 per day. Conversely, high emitters like a typical American (with median U.S. CO$_\text{2}$ emissions) would lose in net \$85 per month, as they would face \$115 per month in price increases (assuming a carbon price of \$90/tCO$_\text{2}$ in 2030). % TD Give the numbers in the Results section

% % Few studies on global policies, but they show support (Ghassim, Carattini 19)
% % Here, two sets of results. First, twenty countries. Second, dig deeper using complementary survey.

% If high emitters share universalistic ethical values, we expect strong support for the GCS, even in high-income countries. On the contrary, if people defend their own financial interest, we expect low support for the GCS in high-income countries. 

% In this paper, we study attitudes toward global policies that address climate change, global poverty or inequalities, with a focus on the GCS. We measure stated support for different global policies using unpublished results from a survey\cite{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022} on climate attitudes conducted in 2021 on 40,680 respondents from 20 countries covering 72\% of global CO$_\text{2}$ emissions. We then conduct a representative survey on 3,000 U.S. respondents to study in detail the sincerity and rationales behind the support for the GCS, the attitudes toward various global policies, global redistribution, and universalistic values.

We measure stated support for different global policies using % TD better way to sell these results?
a survey on climate attitudes conducted in 2021 on 40,680 respondents from 20 countries covering 72\% of global CO$_\text{2}$ emissions (the questions of this survey on national policies are analysed in another paper: \citealp{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022}). We then conduct complementary surveys in the U.S. and four European countries to study in detail the sincerity and rationales behind the support for the GCS, the attitudes toward various global policies, global redistribution, and universalistic values. The U.S. survey has been divided in two waves: \textit{US1} and \textit{US2}, with respectively 3,000 and 2,000 respondents. The European survey, called \textit{Eu}, combines the two U.S. waves (just without one question of US2 that used results from US1). Eu survey comprises 3,000 respondents representative of France, Germany, Spain and the UK, along the dimensions of gender, income, age, highest diploma, country, and degree of urbanisation. The U.S. samples are representative along the same dimensions (with \textit{region} instead of \textit{country}) as well as along ethnicity. Tables \ref{tab:representativeness_waves}-\ref{tab:representativeness_EU} confirm that our samples closely match population frequencies. The questionnaires are given in Appendices \ref{app:questionnaire_oecd} and \ref{app:questionnaire}.

\subsection{International support}
The global survey shows strong support for climate policies enacted at the global level (Figure \ref{fig:oecd}). When asked ``At which level(s) do you think public policies to tackle climate change need to be put in place?'', 70\% (in the U.S.) to 94\% (in Japan) choose the global level. Meanwhile, the European level is chosen by less than half of the European respondents while the federal level is chosen by only 52\% of U.S. respondents. More local levels are generally chosen less than broader ones. This preference for the global level is consistent with (at least) two of the three key motives for supporting climate policies identified in the literature %:
\citep{klenert_making_2018,douenne_yellow_2022,dechezlepretre_fighting_2022}: effectiveness and fairness (the third being self-interest). % GCS more supported in Eu than global T&D. Possible explanations: quota vs. tax, climate club, better understanding / survey fatigue

\end{figure}

Several global policies obtain an absolute majority %more than 70\% relative %
support in all countries: ``a tax on all millionaires in dollars around the world to finance low-income countries that comply with international standards regarding climate action [which] would finance infrastructure and public services such as access to drinking water, healthcare, and education'', % TODO TD shorten
``a global democratic assembly whose role would be to draft international treaties against climate change [where] each adult across the world would have one vote to elect members of the assembly'' (though this one receives only 48\% of support in the U.S.), % we haven't yet defined absolute support at this stage
and an international emissions trading system where ``countries that emit more than their national share would pay a fee to countries that emit less than their share''. 
In high-income countries, this global quota obtains 64\% of absolute (i.e. \textit{somewhat} or \textit{strong}) support and 84\% of relative support (i.e. excluding \textit{indifferent} answers). The support is even higher in middle-income countries, though one should interpret the results with caution in middle-income countries as their samples are only representative of the online population (young, graduated and urban people are over-represented). 
After the support for the global quota, we ask how the carbon budget should be divided among countries. 
Consistent with the literature (see Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_attitudes_burden_sharing}), the preferred burden-sharing rule is to allocate the rights to emit on an equal per capita basis: this fairness principle secures an absolute majority support in all countries, and a relative majority support never below 84\%. 
Taking into account historical responsibilities or vulnerability to climate damages is also popular, though less consensual, while grand-fathering (i.e. allocating emission shares in proportion to current emissions) comes last everywhere. 
The Global Climate Scheme, i.e. a global quota where emission rights are allocated on an equal per capita basis, has the same distributive effects as a global carbon tax that would fund a global basic income. The support for this policy is also tested, and there the redistributive effects are specified to the respondents: the \$30 per month basic income would lift the 700 million people who earn less than \$2/day out of extreme poverty, and fossil price increases would cost the typical person in their country a certain amount (that is provided).  % The average British person would lose a bit from this policy as they would face £42 per month in price increases, which is higher that the £22 they would receive.
Despite their similarity, the global tax is less supported than the global quota, and it even fails to obtain a relative majority in Anglo-saxon countries. This lower support is likely due to the facts that distributive effects are made salient in the case of the tax, and that people may find a quota more effective than a tax to reduce emissions. This interpretation is consistent with the level of support for the global quota once we make the distributive effects salient, which we do in the complementary surveys. % though we cannot exclude that people find a quota more effective than a tax to reduce emissions.

In the complementary surveys, we describe the Global Climate Scheme, explain its distributive effects (specifying the amounts at stake, cf. Appendix \ref{app:gain_gcs}), test the understanding that typical people would lose in high-income countries and that the poorest humans would win using an incentivized question, and then give the correct answer. We proceed the same way for a National Redistribution Scheme (NR) that would tax the top 5\% (in the U.S.) or the top 1\% (in Europe) to finance cash transfers to all adults (calibrated to offset the monetary loss of the GCS for the median emitter), expecting people to find out at the comprehension question that the richest would lose and the typical people in their country would win. Then, we summarize both schemes to make sure that the respondents remember them. Right after, we ask a last incentivized question of comprehension, and later give the expected answer that a typical fellow citizen would neither win nor lose with the GCS and NR combined. Finally, we directly ask the support for the GCS and for NR in a simple \textit{Yes}/\textit{No} question. The stated support for the GCS is at 54\% in US1 and 76\% in Eu, and the support for NR is very close, at 56 and 73\%, respectively (Figure \ref{fig:support_binary}).% TD add something if equality remains

\subsubsection{Global wealth tax} 
Consistent with the global survey's results, a ``tax on millionaires of all countries to finance low-income countries'' receives an absolute majority support of more than 67\% in every country, only 5 p.p. lower than a national millionaires tax overall (Figure \ref{fig:support}). % us2!
To random subsamples, we ask respondents how should the revenues of a global tax on individual wealth in excess of \$5 million be shared with low-income countries, after describing how much revenues such a tax would raise in their country vs. in low-income countries.\footnote{Namely, a 2\% tax on net wealth above \$5 million would raise each year \euro{}5 billion in Spain, \euro{}16 billion in France, £20 billion in the UK, \euro{}44 billion in Germany, \$430 billion in the U.S., and \$1 billion in all low-income countries taken together (28 countries, home to 700 million people).} To some respondents ($n$ = 891), we ask what percentage of the global tax revenues should be pooled to finance low-income countries. In each country, at least 88\% of respondents answer a positive amount, with an overall average of 30\% (Germany) to 36\% (U.S., France) (Figure \ref{fig:global_share_mean}). To some other respondents ($n$ = 859), we ask whether they would prefer that each country retains the revenues it collected or that half of the revenues be pooled to finance low-income countries. About half of the people prefer to channel half of the tax revenues to low-income countries.

\subsubsection{Other global policies} % NCCcomment
We also test support for other %more realistic
global policies (Figure \ref{fig:support}). All receive relative majority support in each country except two:  the ``cancellation of low-income countries' public debt'' and ``a maximum wealth limit'' (the latter obtains relative majority support in Eu but not in the U.S., despite the cap being defined as \$10 billion the U.S. instead of \euro{}/£100 million in Eu). Climate-related policies are particularly popular: ``high-income countries funding renewable energy in low-income countries'' obtains absolute majority support everywhere while loss and damages compensation (which was approved at the COP27) receives a relative support of 55\% (U.S.) to 81\% (Spain).

% H0: Foreign aid: less than 20\% want a decrease (because nationalist), median wants increase at some conditions (no diversion, human rights) => GCS mostly addresses these points
\subsubsection{Foreign aid} % NCCcomment
%eu! 
After providing the amount %explaining that ``0.4\% of U.S. government spending (that is, 0.2\% of U.S. GDP) is 
``spent on foreign aid to reduce poverty in low-income countries'' (in proportion to their country's government spending and GDP), less than 16\% state that their country's foreign aid should be reduced while 62\% state that it should be increased, including 17\% who support an unconditional increase (Figure \ref{fig:foreign_aid_raise_support}). To the 45\% who answer that aid should be increased but only if some conditions are respected, we later ask them what condition(s) should be required (Figure \ref{fig:foreign_aid_condition}). The three conditions most chosen are all largely respected by the Global Climate Scheme: ``that we can be sure the aid reaches people in need and money is not diverted'' (chosen by 73\%), ``that recipient countries comply with climate targets and human rights'' (67\%), and ``that other high-income countries also increase their foreign aid'' (48\%). %, we propose different conditions. The most chosen condition (by 74\%) is  and the second most (by 59\%) ``That recipient countries comply with climate targets and human rights''. 
On the other side, not wishing to increase their country's foreign aid is mostly justified by prioritizing one's fellow citizens or viewing each country as responsible for its own fate (Figure \ref{fig:foreign_aid_no}).

\subsection{Sincerity of support}

We use several methods to assess the sincerity of the support for the Global Climate Scheme: a list experiment, a real-stake petition, conjoint analyses, and the prioritization of policies. All methods suggest that the support is either completely sincere, or the share of insincere answers is limited. 

\subsubsection{List experiment}\label{subsubsec:list_exp}  % NCCcomment
% H1: List experiment: There seems to be a 8pp social norm (differential of 3pp with NR). No effect of the number of options. TODO: check literature

By asking \textit{how many} policies within a list respondents support and varying the list among respondents, a list experiment allows identifying the tacit support for a policy of interest. The tacit support is estimated as the difference in the average number of policies supported between two groups, whose list differ only by the inclusion (or not) of that policy \citep{hainmueller_causal_2014}.% respondents who face a list containing the policy, and respondents who face the same list without it. 
List experiments have been used to reveal a social desirability bias that silences racism in Southern U.S. \citep{kuklinski_racial_1997} or the opposition to the invasion of Ukraine in Russia \citep{chapkovski_solid_2022}. % TODO? remove?
As shown in Table \ref{tab:list_exp}, the tacit support for the GCS measured through the list experiment is not significantly lower than the direct stated support. Thus, we cannot reject an absence of social desirability bias in our case.
% The tacit support for the GCS measured through the list experiment is as high as  the direct question in Eu but significantly lower by 5 p.p. in the U.S. This may be the sign of a social norm pushing some Americans to state that they support the GCS although they secretly do not. Still, if there is a social norm in favor of the GCS, there is a similar norm in favor of the National Redistribution Scheme, as the gap between the tacit and direct support for it is comparable (at 6 p.p.). %However, two observations qualify this interpretation. First, the gap between the tacit and direct support for the National Redistribution Scheme is comparable (at 7 p.p.) though we did not expect such a social norm in the case of the national redistribution, as the 95\% who would benefit from it should not feel ashamed to oppose a policy that would benefit them. Second, while we tested the questionnaire on random people in cafés, we noticed that some were confused by the question of the list experiment (asking how many policies from the list they supported), upset with the conservative societal policy (``Marriage only for opposite-sex couples in the U.S.'', ``Death penalty for major crimes'' in Europe), to the point that they did not answer attentively.

\end{table}

% Donation addresses experimenter demand
\subsubsection{Petition}\label{subsubsec:petition} % Addresses hypothetical bias  % NCCcomment
% H1: Petition: Small effect against GCS: -4pp
We ask the respondents whether they are willing to sign a petition (either for the GCS or NR) and inform them that ``we will send the results to the [head of state]'s office, informing [them] what share of [fellow citizens] are willing to endorse the [Global Climate / National Redistribution] Scheme''. Both policies still obtain majority support when the support is framed as a real-stake petition. In the U.S., we cannot reject equality between the support in the real-stake petitions and the simple questions (GCS: $p=.30$; NR: $p=.76$).\footnote{We run paired weighted \textit{t}-tests, i.e. we test the equality in support for a policy on the subsample of respondents who are questioned about this policy for the petition.} In Eu, the support is significantly lower in the petition, by 7 p.p. for the GCS ($p=10^{-5}$) and 4 p.p. for NR ($p=.008$). Although a few Europeans are not willing to sign a petition for a policy they are supposed to support, this affects both policies tested, and the willingness to sign a real-stake petition is still strong: 69\% for the GCS and 67\% for NR.

\subsubsection{Conjoint analyses}\label{subsubsec:conjoint} % Addresses acquiescence bias  % NCCcomment
% H1, H2: Conjoint analysis: G|C+R 56%, G|R 59%, G 48% ~ C (|R), G+C|R 56%, C|R 64%, Left+G - Left = -3pp, A+G vs. B 59%
% => G is supported for itself, rather independently from R or C, with similar support to both, and it doesn't significantly penalize the Left, and would help a Democratic candidate
In our \textit{conjoint analyses}, we ask respondents to make five choices between pairs of political platforms. The first conjoint analysis suggests that the GCS is supported for itself, independently of being complemented by the National Redistribution Scheme and a national climate policy (``Coal exit'' in the U.S., ``Thermal insulation plan'' in Eu, denoted C). Indeed, 54\% of %($n$ = 3,000) 
U.S. respondents and 74\% of %($n$ = 3,000) 
Eu ones prefer the combination of C, NR and the GCS to the combination of C and NR alone, indicating a similar support for the GCS conditional on NR and C than for the GCS alone (Figure \ref{fig:conjoint}). % (as it does not significantly differ from the direct support of 53\%). 
For the second analysis, we split the sample into four random branches. Results from the first branch show that the support for the GCS conditional on NR, at 55\% in the U.S. ($n$ = 757) and 77\% in Eu ($n$ = 746), is not significantly different from the support for the GCS alone. This suggests that rejection to the GCS is not driven by the cost of the policy on oneself. The second branch shows that the support for C conditional on NR is somewhat higher, at 62\% in the U.S. ($n$ = 751) and 84\% in Eu ($n$ = 747). However, the third one shows no significant preference for C compared to GCS (both conditional on NR), neither in Eu, where GCS is preferred by 52\% ($n$ = 741) nor in the U.S., where C is preferred by 53\% ($n$ = 721). The fourth branch shows that 55\% in the U.S. ($n$ = 771) and 77\% in Eu ($n$ = 766) prefer the combination of C, NR and the GCS to NR alone. % TODO? figure?

In other words, there is majority support for the GCS and for a national climate policy C, which are seen as neither complement nor substitute; a few people seem to like a national climate policy and dislike a global one, but as many people prefer a global rather than a national policy; and there is no evidence that a National Redistribution would increase the support for the GCS. % TD rework this paragraph

In the third analysis, we present to two random branches of the sample hypothetical progressive and conservative platforms that differ only by the presence (or not) of the GCS in the progressive platform. Table \ref{tab:conjoint_c} shows that a progressive candidate would not significantly lose voting share by endorsing the GCS in any country, and may even gain 11 p.p. ($p = .005$) in voting intention in France. Although not significant at the 5\% threshold, the effect is also positive at 3 p.p. ($p = .13$) in the U.S. % France holds multiple hypotheses testing

%The third analysis suggests that a progressive candidate would not significantly lose voting share if he or she were to endorse the GCS, and that he or she may even gain 11 p.p. vote intention in France (see Table \ref{tab:conjoint_c}). To estimate this, we present to two random branches of the sample hypothetical progressive and conservative platforms that differ only by the presence (or not) of the GCS in the progressive platform.

\end{table}

Our last two analyses (four and five) make people choose between two random platforms. In Eu, respondents are prompted to imagine that a left- or center-left coalition will win the next election and are asked what platform they would prefer that coalition to have campaigned on. In the U.S., the question is framed as a hypothetical duel in a Democratic primary, and asked only to non-Republicans ($n$ = 2,218), i.e. the respondents who choose \textit{Democrat}, \textit{Independent}, \textit{Non-Affiliated} or \textit{Other} for their political affiliation. In the fourth analysis, a policy (or an absence of policy) is randomly drawn for each platform in each of five categories: \textit{economic issues}, \textit{societal issues}, \textit{climate policy}, \textit{tax system}, \textit{foreign policy} (Figure \ref{fig:ca_r}). 
Except for the category \textit{foreign policy}, which features the GCS 42\% of the time, the policies are prominent progressive policies and they are drawn uniformly. % except for tax1: .35 vs. tax2: .4 in EU. 
In the UK, Germany, and France, a platform is about 9 to 13 p.p. more likely to be preferred if it includes the GCS rather than no foreign policy.\footnote{This is the Average Marginal Component Effect computed following \citet{hainmueller_causal_2014}.} This effect is between 1 and 4 p.p. and no longer significant in the U.S. and in Spain. 
Moreover, a platform that includes a global tax on millionaires rather that no foreign policy is 9 to 13 p.p. more likely to be preferred in all countries but Spain (not significant, at +5 p.p.). Likewise, a global democratic assembly on climate change has a significant effect of 8 to 12 p.p. in the U.S., Germany, and France. 
%In each country, a platform is more likely to be preferred if it includes the GCS rather than no foreign policy. This effect is significant in France, Germany and the UK, where a platform is about 10 p.p. more likely to be preferred. 
These effects are large, and not far from the effects of the policies most influential on the platforms, which range between 15 and 18 p.p. in most countries (and 27 p.p. in Spain), and all relate to improved public services (in particular healthcare, housing and education).

The fifth analysis draws random platforms in a similar ways, except that candidate A's platform always contains the GCS while B's includes no foreign policy. In this case, A is chosen by 60\% in Eu %($n$ = 3,000) 
and 58\% in the U.S. (Figure \ref{fig:conjoint_left_ag_b}). %($n$ = 2,218). 
In the U.S. for example, our conjoint analyses indicate that a candidate at the Democratic primary would have more chances to obtain the nomination by endorsing the GCS, and this endorsement would not penalize her or him at the presidential election. This result reminds the finding that 12\% of Germans shift their voting intention from SPD and CDU/CSU to the Greens and the Left when they are told that the latter parties support global democracy \citep{ghassim_who_2020}.

\subsubsection{Prioritization} % Addresses acquiescence bias and social desirability bias
% H1: Prioritization: G has mean only slightly lower than average, makes better than ban of cars and coal exit; global tax on millionaires does as well as wealth tax and almost as good as $15 minimum wage
At the end of the survey, we pick six policies at random (and uniformly) among the policies used in the last conjoint analyses, and ask respondents to allocate 100 points among them (using sliders), with the instruction that ``the more you give points to a policy, the more you support it''. For each policy presented, the average support is thus 16.67 points. %(Figure \ref{fig:points}). % TODO! figures for each country
In each country, the GCS ranks in the middle of all policies or at a higher rank, with an average number of points from 15.4 (U.S.) to 22.9 (Germany). 
In Germany, the the global tax on millionaires is the most prioritized policy and  the GCS the second most. The global tax on millionaires ranks at worst in fifth position in every country, and receives an average number of points from 18.3 (Spain) to 22.9 (Germany). 
This question further reveals the potential mismatch between policies prioritized by the public and those enacted by legislators. Indeed, to ``ban the sale of new combustion-engine cars by 2030'' is one of the three least prioritized policies in each country, with an average of 7.8 (France) to 11.4 (UK), and yet the European Union and California have enacted to phase out %a target of no 
new combustion-engine cars by 2035. 
%It is higher than to ``ban the sale of new combustion-engine cars by 2030'' (13.4) and ``coal exit'' (10.0), but lower than the third climate policy: ``trillion dollar investment in clean transportation infrastructure and building insulation'' (20.3). The support for other globally redistributive policies is variable: ``Doubling foreign aid'' is the least supported policy (8.4), while the ``Global tax on millionaires'' is one of the five policies with more than 20 points (20.2), and the ``global democratic assembly on climate change'' is just below the GCS (14.5). The most supported policies are ``Funding affordable housing'' (28.5), ``\$15 minimum wage'' (23.8), and ``Universal childcare/pre-K'' (22.1). % TODO? share that allocated at least 1

\subsection{Second-order beliefs}
% H3 belief: No pluralistic ignorance
To explain a strong support for the GCS despite its absence from political platforms and the public debate, we hypothesized pluralistic ignorance, i.e. that most people and policy-makers wrongly perceive the GCS as unpopular. People would then hide their support for such globally redistributive policies, knowing that advocating for them would be vain. We find limited evidence for pluralistic ignorance in an incentivized question on the perceived support (Figure \ref{fig:belief}). Americans have quite accurate beliefs regarding the level of support for the GCS. Indeed, the mean (resp. quartiles) perceived support is 52\% (resp. 36\%, 52\%, 68\%%, $n$ = 3,000
) vs. an actual support of 53\%. Europeans underestimate the support by 17 p.p., but 65\% of them correctly guess that the GCS obtains a majority (mean of 59\% and quartiles of 43\%, 61\%, 74\% vs. an actual support of 76\%). For the record, the second-order beliefs are equally accurate for the National Redistribution Scheme in the U.S., and equally underestimated in Eu.%, with mean (resp. quartiles) perceived support of 54.7\% (resp. 40, 55, 71\%, $n$ = 3,000) vs. 56\%.

\subsection{Universalistic values}
% H4: A strong majority is universalist/cosmopolitan (TODO: which word?), even a majority for non-Republican
% TD It is not obvious how these answers are informative of malleable opinions. So I don't think we should state the hypothesis and sell this as a test.
%Another hypothesis to explain the discrepancy between the lack of interest for global policies in the public debate despite a strong stated support is that opinions on the topic are weak and malleable. A way to test this is to
We ask broad questions on people's values to see whether their core values are consistent with universalism. When asked what group they defend when they vote% ($n$ = 6,000)
, 20\% choose ``sentient beings (humans and animals)'', 22\% ``humans'', 33\% their fellow citizens (or ``Europeans''), 15\% ``My family and myself'', and the rest (10\%) choose another group (mostly ``My State or region'' or ``People sharing my culture or religion''). The first two categories can be described as universalist, and they represent close to one out of two people. The share of universalist even constitutes a majority of left-wing voters. % TODO check
When asked what should their country's diplomats defend in international climate negotiations, only 11\% prefer their country's ``interests, even if it goes against global justice''; 30\% prefer global justice (mitigated or not by national interests) and the bulk of respondents (38\%) prefer their country's ``interests, to the extent it respects global justice''. % ($n$ = 6,000). 
Furthermore, when asked to judge the extent to which climate change, global poverty, and inequality in their country are an issue, climate change is generally viewed as the biggest problem (with a mean of 0.59 once we recode answers between $-2$ and $2$), followed by global poverty (0.42) and national inequality (0.37). %, $n$ = 6,000). 
% TODO! heatmap with universalist, nationalist, egoist, only country's interest, country's interest respecting global, mostly global justice, problem CC, pov, ineq
Finally, we elicit unversalistic values through a lottery experiment. We automtically enroll the respondents in a lottery with one \$100 prize. Respondents have to choose which share of the prize to keep for themself vs. give to a person living in poverty. The charity donation is destined either for an African or a fellow citizen, depending on the respondent's random branch. We observe no significant variation in the willingness to donate in function of the recipient's origin in Eu, and a donation lower by 3 p.p. for the African in the U.S. (the average donation is 34\%). Moreover, the slightly lower donations to Africans are entirely driven by right-wing voters or non-voters. 
Overall, answers to these broad value questions are consistent with half of Americans and three quarters of Europeans supporting global policies like the GCS: people are almost as much willing to give to poor Africans than to poor fellow citizens, find that global issues are among the biggest problems, almost half of them are universalist when they vote, and most of them wish that their diplomats take into account global justice.


\section{Discussion} % Summary, conclusion
In 20 among the largest countries, we find strong majority support for global climate policies, even in high-income countries that would financially lose from the globally redistributive policies that we test. The complementary surveys in the U.S. and four European countries confirm these results. For example, there is a strong support for global taxes on the wealthiest, and majority support for our main policy of interest, a Global Climate Scheme that would establish both carbon pricing at the global level through an emissions trading system, and a global basic income funded by its revenues. A list experiment and a real-stake petition show that the support for the GCS is mostly sincere. This genuine support is confirmed by the prioritization of this global climate policy above some prominent national climate policies, and consistent with close to half of the population holding universalistic (rather than nationalistic or egoistic) values. Moreover, the conjoint analyses reveals that a progressive candidate should not lose voting shares by endorsing the GCS, and should even get a voting share 11 p.p. higher in France. Likewise, a candidate endorsing the GCS would win votes at a U.S. Democratic primary, while in Europe, a progressive platform including the GCS would be preferred to a platform not including it. %, and would even win votes at the Democratic primary by doing so. 
Besides a potential lack of sincerity or weak opinions, we dismiss another hypothesis that could have explained the scarcity of global policies in the public debate despite a strong support: that people underestimate the support of their fellow citizens. As we ruled out all hypotheses of our registration plan,\footnote{The project was preregistered in the Open Science Foundation registry (\href{https://osf.io/fy6gd}{osf.io/fy6gd}).} we now need to study new explanations. %formulate new hypotheses.

% LM Similarly to Thomas' comment, I had to read this three times before getting it. I had the other idea that it might help to link to the pre-analysis plan here. That would help me understand what is implied. 
We see four potential explanations for the scarce mention of globally redistributive policies in the public debate and political platforms. Among the new hypotheses, the first two are variations of pluralistic ignorance, and the last two represent complementary (rather than substitute) explanations. First, there may be pluralistic ignorance of univeralistic values, of the support for the GCS, or of the electoral advantage of endorsing it \textit{among policy makers}. Second, people or policy makers may believe that globally redistributive policies are politically infeasible in some key (potentially foreign) countries like the U.S.  We intend to test these hypotheses by running a survey on %Congress staffers and 
Members of the European Parliament. 
%Second, there may be a more subtle form of pluralistic ignorance: although most people correctly predict what people would answer to a survey question, they may view globally redistributive policies as unrealistic, perhaps because they have never reflected upon the fact that many people across the world hold univeralistic values and are supportive of global solidarity. Third, most people and perhaps even most policy makers may have simply never heard of the GCS, let alone built their political ideas upon it. 
Third, most institutions are national: the largest scale votes take place at the national level% so political platforms are devised at this level
, most media target a national audience, most commentators frame their discourse from a national perspective and portray relations to foreign countries as conflictual. The prominence of national institutions may create a nationalistic bias in political thoughts, silencing people's univeralistic values. 
% unrealistic, never heard of, technical implementation
Fourth, most people and perhaps even most policy makers may have simply never heard of specific global redistributive policies, %like the GCS, 
let alone built their political ideas upon it. Being unaware of prominent global policy proposals, people or policy makers would cautiously doubt that they are well-specified or technically implementable, and would therefore dismiss them as unrealistic. % TODO? rewrite as a fifth hypothesis that the policies may indeed not be well specified nor implementable?
The ignorance of the GCS itself seems supported by the feedback fields, where the most common answer is a variation upon ``thank you for this interesting, thought-provoking survey''. % doesn't apply to millionaire tax
% TODO! add swing state analysis
% TODO! add reweighted estimate

% Also: vested interest influence on elites (a la Gilens and Page for the US), cf. Boone story
% decline of support the more specific a measure gets / enters the public debate
% people not believing that the policy is technically implementable
% politicians seeing defects or lack of specification of the policy that warrant opposition, while ignorant citizens would naively like it

% LM This are all legtimiate and important points. For a global transfer (rather than say a EU transfer), I am really missing remarks about (lack) of quality of governance, rent creation and capture, corruption etc. To play devil's advocate, as much as I am sympathetic to the idea, I'm not sure I would currently vote in favor of such policies. Why? Not because I dislike the idea, but I am not sure that my carbon tax rent as a German would actually reach the poor population of Indonesia or Nigeria rather than the pockets of cleptocratic elites :) I'd like the draft to reflect that and could make an attempt to pre-empt that objection based on some references later in the project.
%In any case, 
If any (or several) of the remaining hypotheses is confirmed by evidence, we could draw the same conclusion: % TD But what if they are not? I don't think that would invalidate the conclusion stated below.
There is a strong support for global policies that address climate change and global inequality, even in high-income countries, and the frontier of what is considered politically realistic might soon shift on this issue. Uncovering evidence for this might actually contribute itself to garner more attention to global policies in the public debate. % and political platforms. % TD I don't like this because it sounds a bit like asking editors to publish our work. => changed "Publishing" to "Uncovering"

% \subsection{Data collection.} % WPcomment
\paragraph{\small Data collection.} % NCCcomment
The paper relies on two different sets of surveys. The first set of surveys was conducted between March 2021 and March 2022 on 40,680 respondents from 20 countries  (between 1,465 and 2,488 respondents per country). The first U.S. complementary, denoted US1, was conducted on 3,000 U.S. respondents between January and March 2023. The Eu complementary survey is conducted on 3,000 respondents between February and March 2023 (data collection is still ongoing on March 23, as $n$ = 2,979). The second U.S. complementary has started in March 2023, with an expected sample size of 2,000. 
We used the survey companies \emph{Dynata} and \emph{Respondi}. Stratified quotas ensure that the samples are representative along the dimensions of gender, age (5 brackets), income (4), region (4), education level (3), as well as ethnicity (3) for the U.S. % TODO and urbanity instead of education for OECD, TODO table representativeness
To correct for small remaining imbalances, we apply survey weights throughout the analysis, constructed using the quotas variables as well as the degree of urbanity, and trimmed between 0.25 and 4. Weights make the results fully representative of the country (or of Eu in the case of results at the Eu level, where different weights are used). %\footnote{We trim weights so that no respondent receives a weight below 0.25 or above 4. Overall, trimming changes the weights for xx\% of the respondents.} 
Appendix \ref{app:representativeness} confirms that our samples are representative of the population.

% \subsection*{\small Data quality.} % WPcomment % TODO attrition analysis
\paragraph{\small Data quality.} % NCCcomment
The median duration is 28 minutes for the global survey and 15 minutes in the US1 survey. To ensure the best possible data quality, we exclude respondents who fail an attention test or rush through the survey (i.e. answer in less than 11.5 minutes in the global survey, 4 minutes in US1 or US2, 6 minutes in Eu). %All the results and analyses use survey weights, defined to make the results fully representative of the country (or of Eu in the case of results at the Eu level) along the quota variables. Weights are trimmed to be between .25 and 4. 
%\textit{Ex post}, we checked that there were only a few careless response patterns (such as choosing the same answer for all items in a matrix of questions; see Appendix \ref{app:data_quality}). At the end of the survey, we ask whether respondents thought that our survey was politically biased and provide some feedback. 67\% of the respondents found the survey unbiased. 25\% found it left-wing biased, and 8\% found it right-wing biased.

% \subsection*{\small Questionnaires and raw results.} % WPcomment
\paragraph{\small Questionnaires and raw results.} % NCCcomment
% Possible confusion in the questionnaire: people confuse GCS with the four policies together (so support for GCS can suffer from dislike of death penalty), although this confusion is mitigating by the fact that we right after ask about NR; people may answer about revenue-use rather than the whole measure for ETS2 support; people may answer that GCS will or will not have the effects proposed rather than these effects being important or not in their attitude towards GCS; they may answer that it's important that others (not them) get more information; the minimum wage could be reduced at 50% of local median wage.
The questionnaire and raw results of the global survey can be found in the Appendix of the companion paper \citep{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022}. %.\cite{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022} 
The raw results are reported in Appendix \ref{app:raw_results}\footnote{Country-specific raw results are also available as supplementary material files:  \href{https://github.com/bixiou/global_tax_attitudes/raw/main/paper/app_desc_stats_US.pdf}{US}, \href{https://github.com/bixiou/global_tax_attitudes/raw/main/paper/app_desc_stats_EU.pdf}{EU}, \href{https://github.com/bixiou/global_tax_attitudes/raw/main/paper/app_desc_stats_FR.pdf}{FR}, \href{https://github.com/bixiou/global_tax_attitudes/raw/main/paper/app_desc_stats_DE.pdf}{DE}, \href{https://github.com/bixiou/global_tax_attitudes/raw/main/paper/app_desc_stats_ES.pdf}{ES}, \href{https://github.com/bixiou/global_tax_attitudes/raw/main/paper/app_desc_stats_UK.pdf}{UK}.} while the surveys' structures and questionnaires are given in Appendices \ref{app:questionnaire_oecd} and \ref{app:questionnaire}. The questionnaires are the same as the ones given \textit{ex ante} in the registration plan (\href{https://osf.io/fy6gd}{osf.io/fy6gd}).

% \subsection*{\small Incentives.} % WPcomment
\paragraph{\small Incentives.} % NCCcomment
To encourage respondents to answer accurately and truthfully, several questions of the US1 survey use incentives. For each of the three comprehension questions that follow the policies' descriptions, we reward three (randomly drawn) respondents with the correct answer with a \$50 gift certificate. For each of the questions asking respondents to guess the share of support for the GCS and NR, we reward three people who are closest to the true value with a \$50 gift certificate. For the donation lottery question, we randomly draw one respondent and split the \$100 prize between the NGO GiveDirectly and the winner according to the winner's choice. In total, our incentives scheme distributes gift certificates (and donation) for a value of \$850. Finally, respondents have an incentive to answer truthfully to the petition question, given that they know that the results to that question (the share of respondents supporting the policy) will be transmitted to the U.S. President's office.
