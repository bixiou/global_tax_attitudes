% 1 Der Kanton Basel-Stadt gewährt jährlich Beiträge für internationale Entwicklungszusammenarbeit. Der Umfang der Beiträge entspricht mindestens 0,3 und höchstens 1 Prozent der kantonalen Steuererträge von natürlichen und
% juristischen Personen.
% 2 Wenn der Kanton einen Bilanzfehlbetrag aufweist oder wenn die letzten drei Rechnungsjahre insgesamt mit einem Defizit von mehr als 50 Millionen Franken abgeschlossen haben, können die jährlichen Beiträge tiefer ausfallen.
% 3 Der Kanton strebt für das Verteilungsverfahren möglichst tiefe Kosten und, wo sinnvoll, eine Koordination mit dem Bund an. Die Vergabe erfolgt an evidenzbasierte Projekte und orientiert sich dazu an der aktuellen wissenschaftlichen Forschung über Wirksamkeit und Wirtschaftlichkeit sowie an den Aspekten der Transparenz und der Ökologie/Nachhaltigkeit. Neben Projektbeiträgen im engen Sinn können auch Mittel für Wirkungsstudien zu diesen Projekten gesprochen werden.
% 4 Der Kanton berücksichtigt bei der Verteilung Nonprofit Organisationen mit Sitz in der Schweiz und schliesst keine Organisationen aufgrund der Höhe ihrer jährlichen Einnahmen/Ausgaben oder ihrer Existenzdauer aus.

% Nature "abstract": Major sustainability objectives could be achieved by global approaches to mitigating climate change and inequality    . For instance, a global carbon price funding a global basic income, called the “Global Climate Scheme” (GCS), would be an effective way to jointly combat climate change and poverty. A key condition for the success of global cooperation is the support of citizens in affluent countries for such globally redistributive policies. Yet, few prior attitudinal surveys have examined support for global policies. To explore relevant public attitudes, we survey over 48,000 respondents from 20 high- and middle-income countries. The responses reveal strong support for global redistributive policies, including the GCS and a global wealth tax aimed at financing low-income countries. A list experiment shows no evidence of social desirability bias in survey responses, majorities are willing to sign a real-stake petition, and global redistribution ranks high in the prioritization of policies. Conjoint analyses reveal that a political platform is more likely to be preferred if it contains the GCS or a global tax on millionaires. In sum, our findings indicate that global redistributive policies are genuinely supported by a majority of the population, even in wealthy nations that would bear a significant burden. Public opinion is therefore not the reason that they do not prominently enter political debates. These results could help draw attention to global policies in the public debate and contribute to their increased prominence.

\begin{abstract}
  %A global carbon price funding a global basic income, called the ``Global Climate Scheme'' (GCS), would be an effective and progressive way to combat climate change and poverty. Yet, such policy is mostly absent from political platforms and the policy debate. Recent surveys on 40,680 respondents in 20 countries covering 72\% of global CO$_\text{2}$ emissions document majority support for this and other global policies. Using a complementary survey on 8,000 respondents in the U.S., France, Germany, Spain and the UK, we test several hypotheses that could reconcile strong stated support with a lack of salience of these issues. The complementary analyses show that the stated support is mostly sincere, as a list experiment shows no evidence of social desirability bias, majorities are willing to sign a real-stake petition, and global redistributive policies rank high in the prioritization of policies. Conjoint analyses reveal that a progressive candidate would not significantly lose voting share by endorsing the GCS in any country, and may even gain 11 p.p. in France. Likewise, a platform is more likely to be preferred if it contains the GCS or a global tax on millionaires. Accurate beliefs about the level of support for the GCS dismisses the hypothesis of pluralistic ignorance of the support. Universalistic attitudes are confirmed in more general questions, including an incentivized donation. In sum, our findings indicate that global policies are genuinely supported by a majority of the population. Public opinion is therefore not the reason that they do not prominently enter political debates.

  We document majority support for policies entailing global redistribution and climate mitigation. Surveys on 40,680 respondents in 20 countries show strong stated support for an effective way to jointly combat climate change and poverty: a global carbon price funding a global basic income, called the ``Global Climate Scheme'' (GCS). Through our main surveys on 8,000 respondents in the U.S., France, Germany, Spain, and the UK, we test several hypotheses that could reconcile strong stated support with a lack of salience in policy circles. 
  The GCS is supported by three quarters of Europeans and half of Americans, even as they understand the policy's cost to them. Using different experiments, we show that the support for the GCS is sincere and that electoral candidates could win votes by endorsing it. More generally, we document widespread support for other globally redistributive policies, such as a wealth tax funding low-income countries or increased foreign aid. In sum, we provide evidence that global policies are genuinely supported by majorities, even in wealthy nations that would bear the burden.

% TD change the intro, e.g. Global poverty and climate change are among the most critical issues faced by the world today", and then explain that the first could be solved by transfer, the second by capping pollution, hence an effective policy to tackle these two problems is the GCS. Yet, this policy is nowhere to be seen in policy debates. Why? In this paper we provide evidence from surveys showing that people all over the world support this policy. To explain this paradox (people stated support vs absence of the policy), we further investigate the sincerity of these claims and rationales behind the support, etc.

Major sustainability objectives could be achieved by global approaches to mitigating climate change and poverty involving transfers from high- to lower-income countries.\citep{budolfson_climate_2021,franks_mobilizing_2018,dennig_inequality_2015,soergel_combining_2021,bauer_quantification_2020,cramton_global_2017} 
For instance, a global wealth tax could finance the Sustainable Development Goals.\citep{piketty_brief_2022} More specifically, if merely 35\% of the revenue were allocated for this purpose, a global 2\% tax on individual wealth in excess of \$5 million could significantly reduce poverty as it would mechanically increase low-income countries' national income by 50\% (as computed on the \href{https://wid.world/world-wealth-tax-simulator/}{WID wealth tax simulator}). 
Besides, global carbon pricing is widely regarded by economists as the benchmark climate policy, as it would efficiently correct the carbon emissions externality. As early as 1990, Michael Grubb stated:\cite{grubb_greenhouse_1990} ``by far the best combination of long term effectiveness, feasibility, equity, and simplicity, is obtained from a system based upon tradable permits for carbon emissions which are allocated on an adult per capita basis'', i.e., equally among human adults. Support for such solution, which we call the ``Global Climate Scheme'', has been renewed ever since.\citep{hoel_carbon_1991,agarwal_global_1991,bertram_tradeable_1992,baer_equity_2000,jamieson_climate_2001,blanchard_major_2021,rajan_global_2021} 

While international negotiations have not yet led to ambitious globally redistributive policies, recent developments suggest that such a change might be underway. The %International Maritime Organization is poised to adopt a global carbon levy on maritime fuel; the 
African Union calls for a global carbon taxation regime,\cite{african_union_african_2023} the UN is setting up a Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation,\cite{un_promotion_2023}

etc. 

A key condition for implementing global policies has remained largely unaddressed: the support of citizens. Using a Global survey on 40,680 respondents from 20 high- and middle-income countries, we reveal substantial support for those policies, especially global climate policies and a global tax on the wealthiest aimed at financing low-income countries (other questions from this survey are analyzed in a companion paper\cite{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022}). Interestingly, even in wealthy nations that would bear a significant burden, majorities of citizens express support for such globally redistributive policies. To better understand public support for global policies in high-income countries, we conduct our Main surveys among 8,000 respondents from France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the U.S. 

% By studying in depth the support for global policies, we are making an ambitious shift in the methodological approach of attitudinal surveys. In general, academic surveys focus on studying effect sizes of some treatment on political attitudes, or the socio-demographic factors that correlate with attitudes.\cite{kuziemko_how_2015,douenne_yellow_2022} The magnitude of support for a given proposal is often regarded as problematic to estimate satisfactorily. %unsuitable for satisfactory estimation. 
% The measure of support is usually left to non-academic pollsters, who rarely apply all the academic best practices: transparency, representative sampling, neutral and precise wording of questions, comparison with existing literature, use of multiple questions and complementary methods to correctly interpret the results. Although estimating the extent of support is challenging, this question seems too important not to be addressed using scientific methods. Absent large scale measurements of public opinion like referenda, surveys remain the best method to assess support or opposition to given policies. In this paper, after a worldwide assessment in the Global survey, we use our Main surveys to carefully measure the support for global policies in Western countries. We inquire the support for various policies, approach the question from diverse angles, and run a battery of pre-registered tests to check whether stated support estimates are reliable.

The focus of the Main surveys is a specific policy aimed at addressing both climate change and poverty, referred to as the ``Global Climate Scheme'' (GCS). It implements a cap on carbon emissions to limit global warming below 2\textdegree{}C. The emission rights are auctioned each year to polluting firms and fund a global basic income, alleviating extreme poverty. 
This archetypal policy exposes respondents to the key trade-off between the benefits and costs of globally redistributive climate policies, as respondents are made aware of the cost that the GCS entails for their country's people. 

After checking that respondents have understood the policy and its cost, we measure the support in a direct \textit{Yes}/\textit{No} question. The GCS is supported by three quarters of Europeans and more than half of Americans. Then, we test for social desirability bias using a list experiment. We find no evidence that people exaggerate their support in the direct question. To assess whether the support would diminish in a context with real stakes, we ask respondents whether they are willing to sign a petition in favor of the GCS, after informing them that the question results will be communicated to their head of state's office. The support is sustained in an environment that approaches real stakes. We then carry out conjoint analyses to neutralize experimenter demand and investigate the priority given to global policies compared to other types of policies. Conjoint analyses reveal that a political platform is more likely to be preferred if it contains the GCS or a global tax on millionaires, and that global policies rank high in the prioritization of policies. Our randomized experiments also show that a candidate would not lose vote intentions by endorsing the GCS, and might even gain up to 11 points in a country like France. An analysis of open-ended fields confirms that support for the GCS is real, and indicates that appeal of the GCS comes from its international nature and its impacts on climate, more than on global poverty. % from addressing climate change at the international level, more than alleviating poverty. 
We also test other global policies and universalistic attitudes. Support is very strong for a global tax on millionaires, and the median respondent prefers to allocate 30\% of the revenues of such a tax to low-income countries. Majorities are willing to increase foreign aid, but only if some conditions are respected, such as making sure the aid is well spent and other high-income countries also increase their contribution. Questions on universalistic values, including a donation experiment, confirm the congruence of underlying values with the support for specific policies. Our diverse approaches also help understand what drives the support. For instance, the evidence indicates that one key reason why increasing foreign aid is not as popular as global policies lies in its unilateral nature.
% We reckon that survey evidence is no panacea, as attitudes can be ambivalent and context-dependent. Nevertheless, we arguably employ the best available methods to address potential concerns, including an experiment assessing how support might be affected by a negative media campaign. 

Overall, our results %  consistently 
point out to strong and genuine support for global climate and redistributive policies, as our experiments confirm the stated support found in direct questions. 
% This suggests that carefully administered surveys can be used to measure the level of support for a given policy. 
Our results contribute to the literature on attitudes toward climate policy, confirming that climate policy is preferred at a global level,\citep{issp_international_2010,beiser-mcgrath_could_2019,sivonen_attitudes_2022,meilland_international_2023} where it is more effective and fair. Indeed, the Global Climate Scheme is largely supported, but a similar policy at the national level is opposed by a majority in many countries,\citep{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022} despite lower costs. Noting that only 13\% of French people declared supporting a national carbon tax with cash transfers during the Yellow Vests movement,\citep{douenne_yellow_2022} surveys appear to accurately reflect the level of support. Therefore, unless support for global policies disappear once they enter the public debate, it seems unlikely that a policy such as the GCS would face major protests. 
In our discussion we offer potential explanations behind the lack of prominence of global policies in the public debate despite this strong support. 
% Finally, while our findings underscore majority support for global policies, converging results from independent surveys are needed to ascertain such novel evidence. %, even in the absence of significant policy proposal. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Major sustainability objectives could be achieved by global approaches to mitigating climate change and poverty involving transfers from high- to lower-income countries \citep{budolfson_climate_2021,franks_mobilizing_2018,dennig_inequality_2015,soergel_combining_2021,bauer_quantification_2020,cramton_global_2017}. 
% Yet international negotiations have not led to ambitious globally redistributive policies. 
% We examine a key condition for achieving sustainability objectives: the support of citizens for such global policies. %This article investigates public attitudes towards such global policies.

% Recent surveys administered to 40,680 respondents from 20 high- and middle-income countries reveal substantial support for those policies, especially global climate policies and a global tax on the wealthiest aimed at financing low-income countries (other questions from these surveys are analyzed in a companion paper, \citealp{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022}). In particular, a global 2\% tax on individual wealth in excess of \$5 million would effectively reduce poverty as it would mechanically increase low-income countries' national income by 50\%, if merely 35\% of the revenue were allocated for this purpose.\footnote{Figures derived from \citet{chancel_world_2022}, the \href{https://wid.world/world-wealth-tax-simulator/}{WID wealth tax simulator}, and the World Bank.} Interestingly, even in wealthy nations that would bear a significant burden, majorities of citizens express support for such globally redistributive policies.% I have added the following lines. TODO? put in a footnote?
% % Using the price and emissions trajectories from the report by \cite{stern_report_2017}, %Stern-Stiglitz report,\cite{stern_report_2017} 
% % we estimate that the basic income would amount to \$30 per month for each human above 15 in 2030, enough to lift out of extreme poverty the 700 million people who live with less than PPP \$2 per day. Conversely, assuming a carbon price of \$90/tCO$_\text{2}$ in 2030, high emitters like a typical American (with median U.S. CO$_\text{2}$ emissions) would lose in net \$85 per month, as they would face \$115 per month in price increases (see details in Appendix \ref{app:gain_gcs}). 


% To gain insights into the factors shaping public support for global policies in high-income countries, we conduct complementary surveys among 8,000 respondents from France, Germany, Spain, the U.S., and the UK. The focus of our approach is a specific policy aimed at addressing both climate change and poverty, referred to as the ``Global Climate Scheme'' (GCS). It implements a cap on carbon emissions to limit global warming below 2\textdegree{}C. The emission rights are auctioned each year to polluting firms and fund a global basic income, alleviating extreme poverty.\footnote{Although the GCS may seem idealistic, we focus on this policy as its key features allow us to expose respondents in a concise and simple way with the key trade-off between the costs and benefits of globally redistributive climate policies.} 
% In the wording of the question, respondents are made aware of the cost to themselves of such global redistribution. 
% The GCS is supported by three quarters of Europeans and half of Americans. We test whether support of the expressed preference is sincere: a list experiment shows no evidence of social desirability bias in survey responses, majorities are willing to sign a real-stake petition (with the question results communicated to the heads of state), and global redistribution ranks high in the prioritization of policies. Conjoint analyses reveal that a political platform is more likely to be preferred if it contains the GCS or a global tax on millionaires. 
% Besides, we uncover strong stated support for other globally redistributive policies such as increased foreign aid or the democratization of global institutions, and most respondents express some degree of universalism in their underlying values. 
% % By employing a list experiment, a real-stake petition (with the question results communicated to the heads of state),

% % On top of addressing both global poverty and climate change, we provide evidence from surveys showing that people all over the world support this policy. Yet, the GCS is nowhere to be seen in policy debates. Why? To explain this paradox (absence of the policy despite majority stated support), we further investigate rationales behind the support for the GCS and the sincerity of these claims, as well as attitudes toward other global policies, global redistribution, and universalistic values. % TODO: rework

% These findings underscore a strong and genuine support for global climate and redistributive policies. %, even in the absence of significant policy proposal.

% Global cooperation is necessary to solve sustainability challenges such as poverty and climate change. Disagreements on burden-sharing, differing priorities and lack of institutional capacity are obstacles to effective global collaboration. One further obstacle, neglected in social science research so far, is the willingness of citizens in affluent countries to bear the costs of the global redistribution associated with effective poverty reduction and climate change mitigation. This article investigates public attitudes towards global policies delivering on climate change mitigation and poverty reduction.

% To explore relevant public attitudes, we use surveys administered to over 40,000 respondents from 20 high- and middle-income countries covering 72\% of global carbon emissions. The responses reveal substantial support for global policies, including global emissions trading and a global wealth tax aimed at financing low-income countries. Surprisingly, even in wealthy nations that would bear a significant burden, majorities of citizens express support for globally redistributive measures.

% To gain insights into the factors shaping public support in these countries, we conducted complementary surveys among 8,000 respondents from France, Germany, Spain, the U.S., and the UK. The focus is a specific policy aimed at addressing both climate change and extreme poverty, referred to as the ``Global Climate Scheme'' (GCS). It consists of global emissions trading, which limits total carbon emissions. The emission rights are auctioned each year to polluting firms and fund a global basic income. By employing a list experiment, a real-stake petition, and conjoint analysis, our study demonstrates the genuine and robust support for the GCS among respondents. For example, the conjoint analysis provides evidence that policymakers do not lose public support by endorsing the GCS.

% These findings underscore a strong demand for globally redistributive climate policies, even in the absence of significant policy implementation. In our discussion we offer potential explanations behind this policy implementation gap.


% Ethical theories often warrant transfers from high- to low-income people, hence from high- to low-income countries. This is the case of utilitarianism, the benchmark ethical theory used in economics. Utilitarianism assigns the same weight to each person and thus considers that a dollar is better allocated to a low-income person, which has a higher marginal utility than a high-income person.\cite{mill_utilitarianism_1861} 

% Addressing global poverty, inequalities and climate change are at the heart of the universally agreed Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). % 12 out of  17
% It has been pointed out that low-income countries generally do not have enough domestic resources to eliminate the poverty gap in the short run.\cite{bolch_arithmetics_2022} % In other words, it would hardly be possible to achieve the first SDG and end extreme poverty by 2030 without international transfers. => Careful, Bolch use a poverty line above the SDG one.

% Climate change is another issue that calls for a global response and in particular international transfers. Postulating %Assuming
% that each human has an equal right to emit CO$_\text{2}$, low emitters have a legitimate claim \textit{vis-à-vis} high emitters, that can be settled by monetary transfers. Coupling this burden-sharing principle to the carbon budget (remaining emissions that would be compatible with the Paris agreement) naturally defines a global climate policy. We call it the ``Global climate scheme'' (GCS); it consists of a global cap-and-trade system where emission rights are auctioned each year to polluting firms and the revenues finance a global basic income. Using the price and emissions trajectories from the Stern-Stiglitz report,\cite{stern_report_2017} we estimate that the basic income would amount to \$30 per month for each human above 15 in 2030, enough to lift out of extreme poverty the 700 million people who live with less than PPP \$2 per day. Conversely, high emitters like a typical American (with median U.S. CO$_\text{2}$ emissions) would lose in net \$85 per month, as they would face \$115 per month in price increases (assuming a carbon price of \$90/tCO$_\text{2}$ in 2030). % TD Give the numbers in the Results section
% % G default policy for economists, we focus on it; transfers at heart of COP; global wealth tax proposed by Piketty, Saez (fair and effective); democratisation of int'l institutions recurring topic.

% % Few studies on global policies, but they show support (Ghassim, Carattini 19)
% % Here, two sets of results. First, twenty countries. Second, dig deeper using complementary survey.

% If high emitters share universalistic ethical values, we expect strong support for the GCS, even in high-income countries. On the contrary, if people defend their own financial interest, we expect low support for the GCS in high-income countries. 

% In this paper, we study attitudes toward global policies that address climate change, global poverty or inequalities, with a focus on the GCS. We measure stated support for different global policies using unpublished results from a survey\cite{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022} on climate attitudes conducted in 2021 on 40,680 respondents from 20 countries covering 72\% of global CO$_\text{2}$ emissions. We then conduct a representative survey on 3,000 U.S. respondents to study in detail the sincerity and rationales behind the support for the GCS, the attitudes toward various global policies, global redistribution, and universalistic values.

\paragraph{Literature} 
% Although international surveys have shown widespread support for costly climate action \citep{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022,leiserowitz_international_2022,andre_globally_2024}, few prior attitudinal surveys have examined policies for global redistribution. Exceptions include \citet{carattini_how_2019}, who study global carbon taxes with international per capita redistribution and find agreement close to 50\% in high-income countries. % TODO?  (but do not examine an emissions cap nor the sincerity of support)
% In addition, \citet{issp_international_2019} uncover near consensus that ``present economic differences between rich and poor countries are too large'' (overall, 78\% agree and 5\% disagree) in each of 29 countries. \citet{fehr_your_2022} show that, contrary to national redistribution, support for global redistribution does not depend on one's income relative to its fellow citizens but on its country's income per capita. \citet{ghassim_public_2022} examine support for global democracy in a range of countries and finds that, in countries governed by a coalition, voting shares would shift by 8 (Brazil) to 12 p.p. (Germany) from parties that are said to oppose global democracy to parties that supposedly support it. Appendix \ref{sec:literature} contains a broader literature review including further attitudinal surveys on global policies (\ref{subsubsec:literature_attitudes_policies}); prior work on attitudes toward climate burden sharing (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_attitudes_burden_sharing}), attitudes toward foreign aid (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_foreign_aid}); global carbon pricing (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_pricing}), global redistribution (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_redistribution}), basic income (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_basic_income}), and global democracy (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_democracy}).
% TODO? Furthermore, correcting misperceptions concerning one's position in the world's income distribution does not affect the support for global redistributive policies.\cite{fehr_your_2022}

International surveys have shown widespread support for costly climate action.\citep{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022,leiserowitz_international_2022} For instance, representative surveys in 125 countries covering 96\% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions show that 69\% of the global population express willingness to contribute 1\% of their income to fight global warming.\cite{andre_globally_2024} International surveys have also uncovered near consensus that ``present economic differences between rich and poor countries are too large'' (overall, 78\% agree and 5\% disagree) in each of 29 countries.\citep{issp_international_2019} 

Yet, few prior attitudinal surveys have examined global redistributive policies. 
A notable exception tests the support for six variants of a global carbon tax on samples in five countries, representative along gender and age.\cite{carattini_how_2019} For a given variant, the sample size is about 167 respondents per country. They find over 80\% support for any variant in India, between 50\% and 65\% in Australia, the UK and South Africa, and 43\% to 59\% in the U.S., depending on the variant. Notably, the support for a global carbon tax funding an equal cash transfer for each human is close to 50\% in high-income countries (e.g., at 44\% in the U.S.). These figures are consistent with our results from the \textit{Global} survey (see Figure \ref{fig:oecd}), where the support is lower for a tax that would ``only'' reduce CO$_\text{2}$ emissions than for a quota that would unambiguously achieve the climate target. 
Relatedly, 66\% of Americans support providing ``financial aid and technical support to developing countries that agree to limit their greenhouse gas emissions'';\cite{leiserowitz_public_2021} and 90\% of Germans want some degree of global redistribution.\cite{fehr_your_2022} 
Besides, in surveys conducted in Brazil, Germany, Japan, the UK and the U.S., support ranges from 55\% to 74\% for ``a global democracy including both a global government and a global parliament, directly elected by the world population, to recommend and implement policies on global issues''.\cite{ghassim_who_2020} % (for example, international peace, world poverty, and climate change)''
Through an experiment, this paper also finds that, in countries where the government stems from a coalition, voting shares would shift by 8 (Brazil) to 12 p.p. (Germany) from parties who are said to oppose global democracy to parties that supposedly support it. For instance, when Germans respondents were told that (only) the Greens and the Left support global democracy, these parties gained respectively 9 and 3 p.p. in vote intentions. %, while the SPD and the CDU-CSU each lost 6 p.p. 

Appendix \ref{sec:literature} contains a broader literature review including further attitudinal surveys on global policies (\ref{subsubsec:literature_attitudes_policies}); prior work on attitudes toward climate burden sharing (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_attitudes_burden_sharing}), attitudes toward foreign aid (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_foreign_aid}); global carbon pricing (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_pricing}), global redistribution (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_redistribution}), basic income (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_basic_income}), and global democracy (Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_democracy}).

% We conduct complementary surveys in the U.S. and four European countries to study in detail the sincerity and rationales behind the support for the GCS, the attitudes toward various global policies, global redistribution, and universalistic values. The U.S. survey has been divided in two waves: \textit{US1} and \textit{US2}, with respectively 3,000 and 2,000 respondents. The European survey, called \textit{Eu}, combines the two U.S. waves (just without one question of US2 that uses results from US1). The Eu survey comprises 3,000 respondents representative of France, Germany, Spain and the UK, along the dimensions of gender, income, age, highest diploma, country, and degree of urbanisation.

\paragraph{Global Survey}

The \textit{Global} survey, conducted in 2021, involved 40,680 respondents from 20 countries, representing approximately 72\% of global CO$_\text{2}$ emissions. 
This survey serves as the basis for measuring stated support for various global policies worldwide. 
Detailed information about the data collection process, sample representativeness, and analysis of questions on national policies can be found in a companion paper.\cite{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022}

\paragraph{Main Surveys}\label{par:surveys}

To delve deeper into the sincerity and rationales behind support for the GCS and attitudes towards global policies, global redistribution, and universalistic values, we conducted the Main surveys in 2023. These surveys are based on a sample of 8,000 respondents from France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the U.S. The European survey (\textit{Eu}) comprises 3,000 respondents, while the U.S. sample was collected in two separate waves: \textit{US1} with 3,000 respondents and \textit{US2} with 2,000 respondents. The survey questions in both the European and U.S. surveys are identical (see Figure \ref{fig:flow_simple}), except for an additional question in \textit{US2} that uses results from \textit{US1} to assess the bandwagon effect.

The Main surveys ensured representativeness along key dimensions: gender, income, age, highest diploma, and degree of urbanization. The \textit{Eu} survey is also representative of its four countries in terms of population size, while the \textit{US1} and \textit{US2} surveys are representative in terms of region and ethnicity. 
Tables \ref{tab:representativeness_waves}-\ref{tab:representativeness_EU} detail how our samples match population frequencies. 
% Tables \ref{tab:representativeness_waves}-\ref{tab:representativeness_EU} confirm that our samples closely match population frequencies. 
More detail on data collection is given in Section \nameref{sec:methods}. The questionnaires used in the surveys are provided in Appendices \ref{app:questionnaire_oecd} and \ref{app:questionnaire}.
% Details regarding the representativeness of the samples are provided in Tables \ref{tab:representativeness_waves}-\ref{tab:representativeness_EU}.



% \subsection{Stated support for global policies}\label{subsec:stated_support}

% The results from both the \textit{Global} and \textit{Complementary} surveys demonstrate robust support for global policies across all surveyed countries, with a clear preference for addressing climate action on a global scale over regional, national, or local approaches.

\subsection{Global support}\label{subsubsec:global_support}

The Global survey shows strong support for climate policies enacted at the global level (Figure \ref{fig:oecd}). %, reproduced from \citealp{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022}). 
When asked ``At which level(s) do you think public policies to tackle climate change need to be put in place?'', 70\% (in the U.S.) to 94\% (in Japan) choose the global level. The next most popular choice is the federal or continental level, favored by 52\% of Americans and less than half of European respondents. Local policies receive the least support. This preference for climate policies implemented at the global scale is in line with the literature\cite{beiser-mcgrath_could_2019} and consistent with individuals' concerns for the fairness and effectiveness of such policies, which have been identified as two of the three key determinants of support, besides self-interest.\citep{klenert_making_2018,douenne_yellow_2022,dechezlepretre_fighting_2022} It could also stem from conditional cooperation, although previous studies indicate that the support for climate policies does not depend on climate action abroad.\citep{aklin_prisoners_2020,tingley_conditional_2014}

Among the four global climate policies examined in the \textit{Global} survey, three policies garner high support across all countries (Figure \ref{fig:oecd}). These policies include a global democratic assembly on climate change, a global tax on millionaires to finance low-income countries contingent on their climate action, and a global carbon budget of +2\textdegree{}C divided among countries based on tradable shares (or ``global quota''), with the allocation of country shares unspecified (see wording in Appendix \ref{app:questionnaire_oecd}). 
%\footnote{The policies were all described with further details to make sure people understood them. Specifically, the policies were presented as follows: an international emissions trading system where ``countries that emit more than their national share would pay a fee to countries that emit less than their share''; ``a tax on all millionaires in dollars around the world to finance low-income countries that comply with international standards regarding climate action [which] would finance infrastructure and public services such as access to drinking water, healthcare, and education''; ``a global democratic assembly whose role would be to draft international treaties against climate change [where] each adult across the world would have one vote to elect members of the assembly''.} 
The three policies garner a majority of absolute support (i.e., ``somewhat'' or ``strong'' support) in all countries (except in the U.S. for the global assembly, 48\% absolute support). In high-income countries, the global quota policy obtains 64\% absolute support and 84\% relative support (i.e., excluding ``indifferent'' answers). %Support for this policy is even higher in middle-income countries, however their samples are only representative of the online population (young, graduated and urban people are over-represented).%due to the over-representation of young, educated, and urban populations in the online sample.

Following the support for the global quota, respondents are asked about their preferences for dividing the carbon budget among countries, as depicted in the third block of Figure \ref{fig:oecd}. Consistent with the existing literature (see Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_attitudes_burden_sharing}), an equal per capita allocation of emission rights emerges as the preferred burden-sharing principle, garnering absolute majority support in all countries and never below 84\% relative support. Taking into account historical responsibilities or vulnerability to climate damages is also popular, albeit with less consensus, while grandfathering (i.e., allocation of emission shares in proportion to current emissions) receives the least support in all countries.

A global carbon tax that funds a global basic income should produce the same distributional outcomes as a global tradable quota with equal per capita emission rights (provided that each country returns equally to its citizens the revenues from emissions trading and to the extent that the carbon price is the same). %\footnote{Similarly,  a global quota with grandfathering is equivalent to a global carbon tax where each country keeps the revenues it collects.} 
The support for the global carbon tax is also tested and its redistributive effects --  the average increase in expenditures along with the amount of the basic income -- are specified to the respondents explicitly  (see box below and Appendix \ref{app:questionnaire}, p. \pageref{subsec:questionnaire_GCS}). %: the \$30 per month basic income would lift the 700 million people who earn less than \$2/day out of extreme poverty, and fossil price increases would cost the typical person in their country a certain amount (that is provided).  % The average British person would lose a bit from this policy as they would face £42 per month in price increases, which is higher that the £22 they would receive.
The support for the carbon tax is lower than for the quota, particularly in high-income countries, and there is no relative majority for the tax in Anglo-Saxon countries (consistently with the levels of support found in the only previous study that tested a global carbon tax\cite{carattini_how_2019}). %\footnote{The levels of support are consistent with the findings of \citet{carattini_how_2019}, the only previous study that tested a global carbon tax.} 
Two possible reasons for this lower support are that distributive effects are made salient in the case of the tax, and that people may prefer a quota, perhaps because they find it more effective than a tax to reduce emissions. The combination of both reasons is consistent with the level of support for the global quota once we make the distributive effects salient, as we do in the Main surveys.

% One possible reason for this discrepancy is the explicit emphasis on the redistributive effects associated with the tax in the survey. The survey informs respondents that the \$30 per month basic income would lift 700 million people earning less than \$2/day out of extreme poverty, while fossil price increases would impose costs (specified in the survey) on the typical person in their country. Although other factors such as perceptions of effectiveness may also influence support for a quota versus a tax, this interpretation aligns with the level of support for the global quota when distributive effects are made salient, as we do in the complementary surveys. 

% The remainder of the paper analyzes the results from the complementary surveys in the U.S. and in Europe. This Section covers the stated support for different global redistributive policies. %the Global Climate Scheme, a global wealth tax, other global policies, and foreign aid.

% \subsection{The Global Climate Scheme}\label{subsec:gcs}%\label{subsubsec:support_gcs}
%\paragraph{Global Climate Scheme}

\subsection{Stated support for the Global Climate Scheme}\label{subsec:gcs_stated_support}

The Main surveys (\textit{US1}, \textit{US2}, \textit{Eu}) include a comprehensive exploration of citizens' attitudes towards the GCS. We present to respondents a detailed description of the GCS and explain its distributive effects, including specific amounts at stake (as specified in the box below). Furthermore, we assess respondents' understanding of the GCS with incentivized questions to test their comprehension of the expected financial outcome for typical individuals in high-income countries (loss) and the poorest individuals globally (gain), followed by the provision of correct answers (Figures \ref{fig:understood_each}-\ref{fig:understood_score}). % TODO? That is, respondents are made aware and we find they understand that the policy will make people in their country poorer. 
% TODO? . 63\% understand the policy will make people in their country poorer, before even we indicate this as the right answer.
The same approach is applied to a National Redistribution scheme (NR) targeting top incomes % the top 5\% (in the U.S.) or top 1\% (in Europe) 
with the aim of financing cash transfers to all adults, %\footnote{The wider base in the U.S. was chosen because emissions are larger in the U.S. than in Europe, and it would hardly be feasible to offset the median American's loss by taxing only the top 1\%.} 
calibrated to offset the monetary loss of the GCS for the median emitter in their country. We evaluate respondents' understanding that the richest would lose and the typical fellow citizens would gain from that policy. % done We proceed the same way for a National Redistribution Scheme (NR) that would tax the top 5\% (in the U.S.) or the top 1\% (in Europe) to finance cash transfers to all adults (calibrated to offset the monetary loss of the GCS for the median emitter), expecting people to find out at the comprehension question that the richest would lose and the typical people in their country would win.
Subsequently, we summarize both schemes to enhance respondents' recall. Additionally, we present a final incentivized comprehension question and provide the expected answer that the combined GCS and NR would result in no net gain or loss for a typical fellow citizen. Finally, respondents are directly asked to express their support for the GCS and NR using a simple \textit{Yes}/\textit{No} question.

\begin{tcolorbox}\label{box:GCS}
  \paragraph{The Global Climate Scheme} The GCS consists of global emissions trading with emission rights being auctioned each year to polluting firms, and of a global basic income, funded by the auction revenues. Using the price and emissions trajectories from the report by Stern \& Stiglitz,\cite{stern_report_2017} and in particular a carbon price of \$90/tCO$_\text{2}$ in 2030, we estimate that the basic income would amount to \$30 per month for every human adult %over the age of 15 
  (see details in Appendix \ref{app:gain_gcs}). %, enough to lift out of extreme poverty the 700 million people who live with less than PPP \$2 per day. Conversely, assuming a carbon price of \$90/tCO$_\text{2}$ in 2030, high emitters like a typical American (with median U.S. CO$_\text{2}$ emissions) would lose in net \$85 per month, as they would face \$115 per month in price increases (see details in Appendix \ref{app:gain_gcs}). 
  We describe the GCS to the respondents as a ``climate club'' and we specify its redistributive effects: The 700 million people with less than \$2/day [in Purchasing Power Parity] would be lifted out of extreme poverty, and fossil fuel price increases would cost the typical person in their country a specified amount (see Appendix \ref{subsec:questionnaire_GCS} for details). The monthly median net cost is \$85 in the U.S., \euro{}10 in France, \euro{}25 in Germany, \euro{}5 in Spain, £20 in the UK.
\end{tcolorbox}

The stated support for the GCS is 54\% in the U.S. and 76\% in Europe, while the support for NR is very similar: 56\% and 73\% respectively (see Figure \ref{fig:support_binary}). 
% The 95\% confidence intervals are $[52.4\%, 55.9\%]$ in the U.S. and $[74.2\%, 77.2\%]$ in Europe. The average support is computed with survey weights, employing weights based on quota variables, which exclude vote. Another method to reweigh the raw results involves running a regression of the support for the GCS on sociodemographic characteristics (including vote) and multiplying each coefficient by the population frequencies. This alternative approach yields similar figures: 76\% in Europe and 52\% or 53\% in the U.S. (depending on whether individuals who did not disclose their vote are classified as non-voters or excluded). Notably, the average support excluding non-voters is 54\% in the U.S.
Appendix \ref{app:determinants} examines the sociodemographic determinants of support for the GCS as well as the beliefs correlated with the support for a global tax on GHG financing a global basic income. The strongest correlates are political leaning, trust in the government and perceptions that the policy is effective at reducing emissions or in one's self-interest. %presents the sociodemographic determinants of GCS support, showing, for instance, stronger support among young people.

\subsection{Robustness and sincerity of support for the GCS}\label{subsec:robustness_sincerity}


We use several methods to assess the sincerity of the support for the GCS: a list experiment, a real-stake petition, conjoint analyses, and the prioritization of policies. All methods suggest that the support is either completely sincere, or the share of insincere answers is limited. 

\subsubsection{List experiment}\label{subsubsec:list_exp} % NCCcomment

% A list experiment is employed to gauge tacit support for a specific policy of interest by asking respondents how many policies within a given list they support. By varying the list among respondents, the difference in number of policies supported can be used to estimate tacit support, revealing potential social desirability biases \citep{hainmueller_causal_2014}.
By asking \textit{how many} policies within a list respondents support and varying the list among respondents, a list experiment allows identifying the tacit support for a policy of interest. 
% The tacit support is estimated as the difference in the average number of policies supported between two groups, whose list differ only by the inclusion of that policy.\citep{hainmueller_causal_2014} % respondents who face a list containing the policy, and respondents who face the same list without it. 
For example, say a first subsample faces the list of policies A, B, and C, while a second subsamples faces the list A, B, C, and GCS. We do not need to know which policies each respondent support to estimate the average (tacit) support for the GCS, we simply need to compute the difference in the average number of supported policies between the two random subsamples.\citep{imai_multivariate_2011} 
% List experiments have been used to reveal social desirability bias, silencing either racism in the Southern U.S.\citep{kuklinski_racial_1997} or opposition to the invasion of Ukraine in Russia.\citep{chapkovski_solid_2022} % TODO? remove?
In our case, as shown in Table \ref{tab:list_exp}, the tacit support for the GCS measured through the list experiment is not significantly lower than the direct stated support. %\footnote{We utilize the difference-in-means estimator, and confidence intervals are computed using Monte Carlo simulation with the R package \textit{list}.\citep{imai_multivariate_2011}} 
Hence, we do not find a social desirability bias in our study.

% The tacit support for the GCS measured through the list experiment is as high as  the direct question in Eu but significantly lower by 5 p.p. in the U.S. This may be the sign of a social norm pushing some Americans to state that they support the GCS although they secretly do not. Still, if there is a social norm in favor of the GCS, there is a similar norm in favor of the National Redistribution Scheme, as the gap between the tacit and direct support for it is comparable (at 6 p.p.). %However, two observations qualify this interpretation. First, the gap between the tacit and direct support for the National Redistribution Scheme is comparable (at 7 p.p.) though we did not expect such a social norm in the case of the national redistribution, as the 95\% who would benefit from it should not feel ashamed to oppose a policy that would benefit them. Second, while we tested the questionnaire on random people in cafés, we noticed that some were confused by the question of the list experiment (asking how many policies from the list they supported), upset with the conservative societal policy (``Marriage only for opposite-sex couples in the U.S.'', ``Death penalty for major crimes'' in Europe), to the point that they did not answer attentively.

   The tacit support for the GCS is estimated by regressing the number of supported policies on the presence of the GCS in the list of policies. The social desirability is estimated as the difference between the tacit and stated support, and it is not significantly different from zero even at a 20\% threshold (see \nameref{sec:methods}).

% Donation addresses experimenter demand
\subsubsection{Petition}\label{subsubsec:petition} % Addresses hypothetical bias  % NCCcomment

% H1: Petition: Small effect against GCS: -4pp
We ask respondents whether they are willing to sign a petition in support of either the GCS or NR policy. We inform them that the petition results will be sent to the head of state's office, highlighting the proportion of fellow citizens endorsing the respective scheme. Even when framed as a petition that might have real stakes, both policies continue to receive majority support. In the U.S., we find no significant difference between the support in the %real-stake 
petitions and the simple questions (GCS: $p=.30$; NR: $p=.76$). %\footnote{Paired weighted \textit{t}-tests are conducted to test the equality in support for a policy among respondents who were questioned about the policy in the petition.} 
In Europe, the petition leads to a comparable lower support for both the GCS (7 p.p., $p=10^{-5}$) and NR (4 p.p., $p = .008$). While some European respondents are unwilling to sign a petition for policies they are expected to support, this effect is not specific to the GCS, and the overall willingness to sign a %real-stake 
petition remains strong, with 69\% expressing support for the GCS and 67\% for NR.

\subsubsection{Conjoint analyses}\label{subsubsec:conjoint} % Addresses acquiescence bias  % NCCcomment
% H1, H2: Conjoint analysis: G|C+R 56%, G|R 59%, G 48% ~ C (|R), G+C|R 56%, C|R 64%, Left+G - Left = -3pp, A+G vs. B 59%
% => G is supported for itself, rather independently from R or C, with similar support to both, and it doesn't significantly penalize the Left, and would help a Democratic candidate

In order to assess the public support for the GCS in conjunction with other policies, we conduct a series of conjoint analyses. We ask respondents to make five choices between pairs of political platforms.

The first conjoint analysis suggests that the GCS is supported independently of being complemented by the National Redistribution Scheme and a national climate policy (C). % (``Coal exit'' in the U.S., ``Thermal insulation plan'' in Europe, denoted C).
%\footnote{Indeed, 54\% of %($n$ = 3,000) 
% U.S. respondents and 74\% of %($n$ = 3,000) 
% European ones prefer the combination of C, NR and the GCS to the combination of C and NR alone, indicating similar support for the GCS conditional on NR and C than for the GCS alone (Figure \ref{fig:conjoint}).} % (as it does not significantly differ from the direct support of 53\%). 
% For the second analysis, we split the sample into four random branches (see \nameref{sec:methods}). 
% % \footnote{Results from the first branch show that the support for the GCS conditional on NR, at 55\% in the U.S. ($n$ = 757) and 77\% in Europe ($n$ = 746), is not significantly different from the support for the GCS alone. This suggests that rejection of the GCS is not driven by the cost of the policy on oneself. The second branch shows that the support for C conditional on NR is somewhat higher, at 62\% in the U.S. ($n$ = 751) and 84\% in Europe ($n$ = 747). However, the third one shows no significant preference for C compared to GCS (both conditional on NR), neither in Europe, where GCS is preferred by 52\% ($n$ = 741) nor in the U.S., where C is preferred by 53\% ($n$ = 721). The fourth branch shows that 55\% in the U.S. ($n$ = 771) and 77\% in Europe ($n$ = 766) prefer the combination of C, NR and the GCS to NR alone.} 
% The outcome is that there is
The second analysis indicates majority support for the GCS and for C, which are seen as neither complement nor substitute (see \nameref{sec:methods}). A minor share of respondents like a national climate policy and dislike a global one, but as many people prefer a global rather than a national policy; and there is no evidence that implementing NR would increase the support for the GCS.


In the third analysis, we present two random branches of the sample with hypothetical progressive and conservative platforms that differ only by the presence (or not) of the GCS in the progressive platform. Table \ref{tab:conjoint_c} shows that a progressive candidate would not significantly lose voting share by endorsing the GCS in any country, and may even gain 11 p.p. ($p = .005$) in voting intention in France. %The effect is also positive at 3 p.p. ($p = .13$) in the U.S., although not significant at the 5\% threshold. % France holds multiple hypotheses testing

% Though the level of support for the GCS is significantly lower in swing States (at 51\%) that are key to win U.S. elections, the electoral effect of endorsing the GCS remains non-significantly different from zero (at +1.2 p.p.) in these States.
% \footnote{We define swing states as the 8 states with less than 5 p.p. margin of victory in the 2020 election (MI, NV, PA, WI, AZ, GA, NC, FL). The results are robust to using the 3 p.p. threshold (that excludes FL) instead.}

%The third analysis suggests that a progressive candidate would not significantly lose voting share if he or she were to endorse the GCS, and that he or she may even gain 11 p.p. vote intention in France (see Table \ref{tab:conjoint_c}). To estimate this, we present to two random branches of the sample hypothetical progressive and conservative platforms that differ only by the presence (or not) of the GCS in the progressive platform.

Our last two analyses  make respondents choose between two random platforms. In Europe, respondents are prompted to imagine that a left or center-left coalition will win the next election and asked what platform they would prefer that coalition to have campaigned on. In the U.S., the question is framed as a hypothetical duel in a Democratic primary, and asked only to non-Republicans ($n$ = 2,218), i.e. the respondents who declare as political affiliation \textit{Democrat}, \textit{Independent}, \textit{Non-Affiliated} or \textit{Other}. In the fourth analysis, a policy (or an absence of policy) is randomly drawn for each platform in each of five categories: \textit{economic issues}, \textit{societal issues}, \textit{climate policy}, \textit{tax system}, \textit{foreign policy} (Figure \ref{fig:ca_r}). 

% Except for the category \textit{foreign policy}, which features the GCS 42\% of the time, the policies are prominent progressive policies and they are drawn uniformly. % except for tax1: .35 vs. tax2: .4 in EU. 
In the UK, Germany, and France, a platform is about 9 to 13 p.p. more likely to be preferred if it includes the GCS rather than no foreign policy. %\footnote{This is the Average Marginal Component Effect.\cite{hainmueller_causal_2014}} 
This effect is between 1 and 4 p.p. and no longer significant in the U.S. (among non-Republicans) and in Spain. Moreover, a platform that includes a global tax on millionaires rather than no foreign policy is 5 to 13 p.p. more likely to be preferred in all countries (the effect is significant and at least 9 p.p. in all countries but Spain). 
% Moreover, a platform that includes a global tax on millionaires rather that no foreign policy is 9 to 13 percentage points (p.p.) more likely to be preferred in all countries but Spain (not significant, at +5 p.p.). 
Similarly, a global democratic assembly on climate change has a significant effect of 8 to 12 p.p. in the U.S. (among non-Republicans), Germany, and France. 
%In each country, a platform is more likely to be preferred if it includes the GCS rather than no foreign policy. This effect is significant in France, Germany and the UK, where a platform is about 10 p.p. more likely to be preferred. 
These effects are large, and not far from the effects of the policies most influential on the platforms, which range between 15 and 18 p.p. in most countries (and 27 p.p. in Spain), and all relate to improved public services (in particular healthcare, housing, and education).

The fifth analysis draws random platforms similarly, except that candidate A's platform always contains the GCS while B's includes no foreign policy. In this case, A is chosen by 60\% of Europeans %($n$ = 3,000) 
and 58\% of non-Republican Americans (Figure \ref{fig:conjoint_left_ag_b}). %($n$ = 2,218). 
Overall, taking the U.S. as an example, our conjoint analyses indicate that a candidate at the Democratic primary would have more chances to obtain the nomination by endorsing the GCS, and this endorsement would not penalize her or him at the presidential election.

\subsubsection{Prioritization}\label{subsubsec:prioritization} % Addresses acquiescence bias and social desirability bias
% H1: Prioritization: G has mean only slightly lower than average, makes better than ban of cars and coal exit; global tax on millionaires does as well as wealth tax and almost as good as $15 minimum wage

Towards the end of the survey, we ask respondents to allocate 100 points among six randomly selected policies from the previous conjoint analyses, using sliders. The instruction was to distribute the points based on their level of support, with a higher allocation indicating greater support for a policy. %At the end of the survey, we pick six policies at random (and uniformly) among the policies used in the last conjoint analyses, and ask respondents to allocate 100 points among them (using sliders), with the instruction that ``the more you give points to a policy, the more you support it''. 
As a result, the average support across policies is 16.67 points. %(Figure \ref{fig:points}). % TODO! figures for each country
In each country, the GCS ranks in the middle of all policies or above, with an average number of points from 15.4 in the U.S. to 22.9 in Germany.%The GCS ranked in the middle or higher among all policies in each country, receiving an average of 15.4 points in the U.S. and 22.9 points in Germany.

Interestingly, in Germany, the most prioritized policy is the global tax on millionaires, while the GCS is the second most prioritized policy. The global tax on millionaires consistently ranks no lower than fifth position (out of 15 or 17 policies) in every country, garnering an average of 18.3 points in Spain to 22.9 points in Germany.

% This question sheds light on a potential discrepancy between the policy priorities of the public and those enacted by legislators. For instance, while the European Union and California have enacted plans to phase out new combustion-engine cars by 2035, the proposal to ``ban the sale of new combustion-engine cars by 2030'' emerged as one of the three least prioritized policies in each country, with an average allocation of 7.8 points in France to 11.4 points in the UK.

%It is higher than to ``ban the sale of new combustion-engine cars by 2030'' (13.4) and ``coal exit'' (10.0), but lower than the third climate policy: ``trillion dollar investment in clean transportation infrastructure and building insulation'' (20.3). The support for other globally redistributive policies is variable: ``Doubling foreign aid'' is the least supported policy (8.4), while the ``Global tax on millionaires'' is one of the five policies with more than 20 points (20.2), and the ``global democratic assembly on climate change'' is just below the GCS (14.5). The most supported policies are ``Funding affordable housing'' (28.5), ``\$15 minimum wage'' (23.8), and ``Universal childcare/pre-K'' (22.1). % TODO? share that allocated at least 1

\subsubsection{Pros and Cons}\label{subsubsec:pros_cons}

We survey respondents to gather their perspectives on the pros and cons of the GCS, randomly utilizing an open-ended or a closed question. In the closed question format, respondents tend to consider every argument as important in determining their support or opposition to the GCS (see Figure \ref{fig:gcs_important}). 
% Notably, the least important aspect was the negative impact on their household, with 60\% in Europe ($n$=1,505) and 75\% in the U.S. ($n$=493) finding it important. The most important elements differ between Europe and the U.S. In Europe, the key factors are the GCS's potential to limit climate change and reduce poverty in low-income countries, both deemed important by 85\% of respondents. In the U.S., having sufficient information about the scheme ranks highest at 89\%, followed by its potential to foster global cooperation at 82\%. However, d
% Due to the limited variation in the ratings for each element, the closed question format is inconclusive (Figure \ref{fig:gcs_important}). % TODO? distinguish between supporters and opponents?

The open-ended question provides more insights into what people associate with the GCS when prompted to think about it. % The open-ended question gives interesting insight into ``what comes to [people's] mind'' when ``thinking of the GCS''. 
Analyzing keywords in the responses (automatically translated into English), the most frequently mentioned topics are the international aspect and the environment, each appearing in approximately one-quarter of the answers (see Figure \ref{fig:gcs_field_contains}). This is followed by discussions on the effects of the GCS on poverty and prices, each mentioned by about one-tenth of the respondents. We also manually classified each answer into different categories (see Figure \ref{fig:gcs_field}). This exercise confirms the findings from the automatic search: the environmental benefit of the GCS is the most commonly discussed topic, while obstacles to implementation or agreement on the proposal are relatively infrequently mentioned.%the most frequent topic is the environmental benefit of the GCS, while the obstacles to implement it or to get %people or countries agreement on it are relatively seldom mentioned.
% \footnote{Moreover, around one in four respondents explicitly cites pros or cons. Few individuals explicitly express support or opposition, and misunderstandings are rare. Only 11\% of the responses are empty or express a lack of opinion, though one-quarter are unclassifiable due to the rarity, nonsensical nature, or irrelevance of the conveyed idea.}% TODO n

% In the \textit{US2} survey, we presented these questions to random subsamples \textit{before} inquiring about support for the GCS or NR. The sample was divided into four branches: two branches with questions on pros and cons (either in closed or open form), one branch providing information on the actual level of support for the GCS and NR (estimated in \textit{US1}), and one control group without these questions.\footnote{Consistent with Americans accurately perceiving the levels of support for the GCS or NR, providing information on the actual level had no substantial effect on their support. In the closed question regarding pros and cons, we intentionally included more cons (6) than pros (3) to conservatively estimate the potential campaign effect on the GCS, which refers to the shift in opinion resulting from media coverage of the proposal. Interestingly, the support for the GCS decreased by 11 p.p. after respondents viewed a list of its pros and cons. Surprisingly, the support for National Redistribution also decreased by 7 p.p. following the closed question about the GCS. This suggests that some individuals may lack attention and confuse the two policies, or that contemplating the pros and cons alters the mood of some people, moving them away from their initial positive impression. Notably, the support also decreased by 7 p.p. after respondents were asked to consider the pros and cons in an open-ended question.} Despite some significant effects of pondering the pros and cons (see Table \ref{tab:branch_gcs}), approximately half of the Americans expressed support for the GCS across all treatment branches. If similar effects were observed in Europe, it suggests that the GCS would still enjoy strong majority support among Europeans once it enters the public debate (Table \ref{tab:branch_gcs}).


In the \textit{US2} survey, we divided the sample into four random branches. Two branches were presented the pros and cons questions (either in open or closed format) \textit{before} being asked about their support for the GCS or NR. Another branch received information on the actual level of support for the GCS and NR (estimated in \textit{US1}, see box p. \pageref{subsec:second_order_beliefs}), %Section \ref{subsec:second_order_beliefs}), 
and one control group received none of these treatments. % TODO? Clarify that the information was also before the support?

The objective of the ``pros and cons treatment'' was to mimic a ``campaign effect'', which refers to the shift in opinion resulting from media coverage of the proposal. To conservatively estimate the effect of a (potentially negative) campaign, we intentionally included more cons (6) than pros (3). Interestingly, the support for the GCS decreased by 11 p.p. after respondents viewed a list of its pros and cons. %\footnote{Surprisingly, the support for National Redistribution also decreased by 7 p.p. following the closed question about the GCS.

Although support remains significant, % relatively high (it would remain majoritarian in Europe if similar effects were observed)

% \subsection{Second-order Beliefs}\label{subsec:second_order_beliefs}
% H3 belief: No pluralistic ignorance
To explain the strong support for the GCS despite its absence from political platforms and public debate, we hypothesized pluralistic ignorance, i.e. that the public and policymakers mistakenly perceive the GCS as unpopular. As a result, individuals might conceal their support for such globally redistributive policies, believing that advocating for them would be futile. 
% However, the evidence for pluralistic ignorance is limited based on an incentivized question about perceived support (Figure \ref{fig:belief}).

In the case of Americans, their beliefs about the level of support for the GCS are relatively accurate (Figure \ref{fig:belief}). The mean perceived support is 52\% (with quartiles of 36\%, 52\%, and 68\%), which closely aligns with the actual support of 53\%. Europeans, on the other hand, underestimate the support by 17 p.p. Nonetheless, 65\% of them correctly estimate that the GCS garners majority support, and the mean perceived support is 59\% (and quartiles of 43\%, 61\%, and 74\%), compared to the actual support of 76\%. % TODO? cut below?

\subsubsection{Global wealth tax}\label{subsubsec:support_global_wealth_tax}
%\paragraph{Global wealth tax}

Consistent with the results of the Global survey, a ``tax on millionaires of all countries to finance low-income countries'' garners relative support of over 69\% in each country, only 5 p.p. lower than a national millionaires tax overall (Figure \ref{fig:support}). In random subsamples, we inquire about respondents' preferences regarding the redistribution of revenues from a global tax on individual wealth exceeding \$5 million, after providing information on the revenue raised by such a tax in their country compared to low-income countries. 
% \footnote{A 2\% tax on net wealth exceeding \$5 million would annually raise \$816 billion, leaving unaffected 99.9\% of the world population. More specifically, it would collect \euro{}5 billion in Spain, \euro{}16 billion in France, £20 billion in the UK, \euro{}44 billion in Germany, \$430 billion in the U.S., and \$1 billion collectively in all low-income countries (28 countries, home to 700 million people).%Figures come from \citet{chancel_world_2022}, the \href{https://wid.world/world-wealth-tax-simulator/}{WID wealth tax simulator}, and the World Bank. % TODO: do they?

We ask certain respondents ($n$ = 1,283) what percentage of global tax revenues should be pooled to finance low-income countries. In each country, at least 88\% of respondents indicate a positive amount, with an average of one-third %ranging from 30\% (Germany) to 36\% (U.S., France) 
(Figure \ref{fig:global_share_mean}). To other respondents ($n$ = 1,233), we inquire whether they would prefer each country to retain all the revenues it collects or that half of the revenues be pooled to finance low-income countries. Approximately half of the respondents opt to allocate half of the tax revenues to low-income countries, consistently with the other variant of the question.

%\paragraph{Other global policies}

We also assess support for other global policies (Figure \ref{fig:support}). Most policies garner relative majority support in each country, with two exceptions: the ``cancellation of low-income countries' public debt'' and ``a maximum wealth limit'' for each individual. % In US pilot (n=86), 36% relative support to cap wealth at 100M (67% in Eu)
The latter policy obtains relative majority support in Europe but not in the U.S., despite the cap being set at \$10 billion in the U.S. compared to \euro{}/£100 million in Europe. Notably, climate-related policies enjoy significant popularity, with ``high-income countries funding renewable energy in low-income countries'' receiving absolute majority support across all surveyed countries. Additionally, relative support for loss and damages compensation, as approved in principle at the international climate negotiations in 2022 (``COP27''), ranges from 55\% (U.S.) to 81\% (Spain). %, with absolute support ranging from 41\% to 62\%.

\subsubsection{Foreign aid}\label{subsubsec:support_foreign_aid} % NCCcomment
%\paragraph{Foreign aid}

We provide respondents with information about the actual amount ``spent on foreign aid to reduce poverty in low-income countries'' relative to their country's government spending and GDP. Less than 16\% of respondents state that their country's foreign aid should be reduced, while 62\% express support for increasing it, including 17\% who support an unconditional increase (Figure \ref{fig:foreign_aid_raise_support}). Among the 45\% who think aid should be increased under certain conditions, we subsequently ask them to specify the conditions they deem necessary (Figure \ref{fig:foreign_aid_condition}). The three most commonly selected conditions are: ``we can be sure the aid reaches people in need and money is not diverted'' (73\% chose this condition), ``that recipient countries comply with climate targets and human rights'' (67\%), and ``that other high-income countries also increase their foreign aid'' (48\%). %\footnote{It is worth noting that these conditions align closely with the principles of the GCS.} 
On the other hand, respondents who do not wish to increase their country's foreign aid primarily justify their view by prioritizing the well-being of their fellow citizens or by perceiving each country as responsible for its own fate (Figure \ref{fig:foreign_aid_no}). In response to an open-ended question regarding measures high-income countries should take to fight extreme poverty, a large majority of Americans expressed that more help is needed (Figure \ref{fig:poverty_field}). The most commonly suggested form of aid is financial support, closely followed by investments in education. 


We also inquire about the perceived amount of foreign aid. Consistent with prior research (see Appendix \ref{subsubsec:literature_foreign_aid}), most people overestimate the actual amount of foreign aid (Figure \ref{fig:foreign_aid_belief}). We then elicit respondents' preferred amount of foreign aid, after randomly presenting them with either the actual amount or no information. Most of the respondents who learn the actual amount choose a bracket at least as high as the actual one, and most of those without the information choose a bracket at least as high as the perceived one (Figures \ref{fig:foreign_aid_amount}--\ref{fig:foreign_aid_preferred_info}). Finally, we ask a last question to the respondents who received the information. To those who prefer an increase of foreign aid, we ask how they would finance it: by far, the preferred source of funding is higher taxes on the wealthiest (Figure \ref{fig:foreign_aid_raise_how}). To those who prefer a reduction, we ask how they would use the funds becoming available: %resulting savings: 
In every country, more people choose higher spending on education or healthcare rather than lower taxes (Figure \ref{fig:foreign_aid_reduce_how}).

The first two categories, representing close to one out of two people, 
can be described as universalist in their vote. Notably, a majority of left-wing voters are universalist in their vote (see Figure \ref{fig:main_by_vote}). % for main attitudes by vote).% The share of universalist even constitutes a majority of left-wing voters

When asked what their country's diplomats should defend in international climate negotiations, only 11\% prefer their country's ``interests, even if it goes against global justice.'' In contrast, 30\% prefer global justice (with or without consideration of national interests), and the bulk of respondents (38\%) prefer their country's ``interests, to the extent it respects global justice.''

Furthermore, when we ask respondents to assess the extent to which climate change, global poverty, and inequality in their country are issues, climate change is generally viewed as the most significant problem (with a mean score of 0.59 after recoding answers between -2 and 2). This is followed by global poverty (0.42) and national inequality (0.37). %, $n$ = 6,000).

Finally, we conduct a lottery experiment to elicit universalistic values. Respondents were automatically enrolled in a lottery with a \$100 prize and had to choose the proportion of the prize they would keep for themselves versus give to a person living in poverty. The charity donation is directed either to an African individual or a fellow citizen, depending on the respondent's random assignment. In Europe, we observe no significant variation in the willingness to donate based on the recipient's origin. In the U.S., the donations to Africans are 3 p.p. lower (with an average donation of 34\%), but the slightly lower donations to Africans are entirely driven by Trump voters and non-voters (Table \ref{tab:donation}).

% TODO! put back?
% Overall, answers to these broad value questions are consistent with half of Americans and three quarters of Europeans supporting global policies like the GCS: people are almost as much willing to give to poor Africans than to poor fellow citizens, find that global issues are among the biggest problems, almost half of them are universalist when they vote, and most of them wish that their diplomats take into account global justice.

\section{Discussion} % Summary, conclusion
% TODO? give less space to OECD paper?
Our point of departure are recent surveys conducted %by \citet{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022} 
in 20 of the largest countries% \citep{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022}
, as they reveal robust majority support for global redistributive and climate policies, even in high-income countries that would financially lose from them. The results from the Main surveys conducted in the U.S. and four European countries %presented here 
reinforce these findings. We find strong support for global taxes on the wealthiest individuals, as well as majority support for our main policy of interest -- the Global Climate Scheme (GCS). The GCS encompasses carbon pricing at a global level through an emissions trading system, accompanied by a global basic income funded by the scheme's revenues. Additional experiments, such as a list experiment and a real-stake petition, demonstrate that the support for the GCS is real. 
Such genuine support is further substantiated by the prioritization of the GCS over prominent national climate policies and aligned with a significant portion of the population holding universalistic values rather than nationalistic or egoistic ones. Moreover, the conjoint analyses indicate that a progressive candidate would not lose voting shares by endorsing the GCS, and may even gain 11 p.p. in voting shares in France. Similarly, a candidate endorsing the GCS would gain votes in a U.S. Democratic primary, while in Europe, a progressive platform that includes the GCS would be preferred over one that does not.

Having ruled out insincerity %and underestimation of fellow citizens' support 
as potential explanation for the scarcity of global policies in the public debate, we propose alternative explanations. %As we ruled out all hypotheses of our registration plan,\footnote{The project was preregistered in the Open Science Foundation registry (\href{https://osf.io/fy6gd}{osf.io/fy6gd}).} we now need to study new explanations.
The first two are variations of pluralistic ignorance, and the last three represent complementary explanations. 

First, there may be pluralistic ignorance \textit{among policymakers} regarding universalistic values, support for the GCS, or the electoral advantage of endorsing it. Second, people or policymakers may believe that globally redistributive policies are politically infeasible in some key (potentially foreign) countries like the U.S. % We intend to test these hypotheses by running a survey on Congress staffers and Members of the European Parliament.  %Second, there may be a more subtle form of pluralistic ignorance: although most people correctly predict what people would answer to a survey question, they may view globally redistributive policies as unrealistic, perhaps because they have never reflected upon the fact that many people across the world hold univeralistic values and are supportive of global solidarity. Third, most people and perhaps even most policy makers may have simply never heard of the GCS, let alone built their political ideas upon it. 
Third, political discourse centrally happens at the national level, shaped by national media and institutions such as voting. 
National framing by political voices may create biases and suppress universalistic values. % Third, most institutions are national: the largest scale votes take place at the national level% so political platforms are devised at this level, most media target a national audience, most commentators frame their discourse from a national perspective and portray relations to foreign countries as conflictual. 
Fourth, many individuals, including policymakers, may perceive global redistributive policies as ill-defined or technically infeasible, ultimately dismissing them as unrealistic. In particular, policymakers may have insider information about the technical feasibility of such policies. Alternatively, the perception of unrealism may stem from an unawareness of specific proposals. % cautiously doubt that they are well-specified
% TODO? rewrite as a fifth hypothesis that the policies may indeed not be well specified nor implementable?
% Fourth, many individuals, including policymakers, may simply be unaware of specific global redistributive policies, let alone base their political ideas on them. This lack of awareness may lead people to % cautiously doubt that they are well-specified
% perceive such policies as ill-defined or technically infeasible, ultimately dismissing them as unrealistic. % TODO? rewrite as a fifth hypothesis that the policies may indeed not be well specified nor implementable?
% The latter hypothesis is supported by the prior ignorance of the GCS expressed in the feedback fields, where a common response is a variation of ``thank you for this interesting, thought-provoking survey.'' 
% TODO? remove?
Fifth, just as policy is disproportionately influenced by the economic elites,\citep{gilens_testing_2014,persson_rich_2023} public debate may be shaped by the wealthiest, who have vested interests in preventing global redistribution.

% Also: vested interest influence on elites (a la Gilens and Page for the US, Persson & Sundell 23), cf. Boone story
% decline of support the more specific a measure gets / enters the public debate => addressed in conclusion of pros and cons
% people not believing that the policy is technically implementable => addressed
% politicians seeing defects or lack of specification of the policy that warrant opposition, while ignorant citizens would naively like it => addressed
% platform don't matter for vote

% LM This are all legtimiate and important points. For a global transfer (rather than say a EU transfer), I am really missing remarks about (lack) of quality of governance, rent creation and capture, corruption etc. To play devil's advocate, as much as I am sympathetic to the idea, I'm not sure I would currently vote in favor of such policies. Why? Not because I dislike the idea, but I am not sure that my carbon tax rent as a German would actually reach the poor population of Indonesia or Nigeria rather than the pockets of cleptocratic elites :) I'd like the draft to reflect that and could make an attempt to pre-empt that objection based on some references later in the project.
%In any case, 

Confirmation of any of these hypotheses would lead to a common conclusion: there exists substantial support for global policies addressing climate change and global inequality, even in high-income countries, and the perceived boundaries of political realism on this issue may soon shift. %Recent developments suggest that such a change might be underway: the \citet{african_union_african_2023} calls for a global carbon taxation regime, a call quickly endorsed by the President of the EU Commission;\footnote{Cf. this tweet by Ursula von der Leyen: \href{https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1700416700238225659}{twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1700416700238225659}.} the \citet{un_promotion_2023} is setting up a Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, where various countries want to open discussions about a global wealth tax; Brazil uses its presidency of the G20 in 2024 to propose a global tax to finance sustainable development; the International Maritime Organization is poised to adopt a global carbon levy on maritime fuel; etc. 
Uncovering evidence to support the above hypotheses could %help
draw attention to global policies in the public debate and contribute to their increased prominence. % Uncovering evidence for this might actually contribute itself to garner more attention to global policies in the public debate. 

% Also: no short term outcome (before the end of the mandate) so no incentive to start it

% TODO!? alternative conclusion: strong and sincere support for global wealth tax in both continents => probable reason why it's not more discussed is that it's not the determining issue for voters. Strong and sincere support for the GCS in Europe but half-half in the U.S. (where there is a risk that support decreases in a campaign) => not endorsed by the Democrats because they seek policies more strongly supported, and not discussed in Europe probably because the U.S. won't support it.

The \textit{Eu} complementary survey was conducted on 3,000 respondents between February and March 2023. We used the survey companies \emph{Dynata} and \emph{Respondi}. Stratified quotas ensure that the samples are representative along the dimensions of gender, age (5 brackets), income (4), region (4), education level (3), as well as ethnicity (3) for the U.S. To correct for small remaining imbalances, we apply survey weights throughout the analysis, constructed using the quotas variables as well as the degree of urbanity, and trimmed between 0.25 and 4. Weights make the results fully representative of the country (or of the four European countries combined in the case of results at the European level, where different weights are used). Appendix \ref{app:representativeness} confirms that our samples are representative of the population. % TODO! and urbanity instead of education for OECD, TODO table representativeness

The paper utilizes two sets of surveys: the \textit{Global} survey and the \textit{Main} surveys. The \textit{Main} surveys consist of two U.S. surveys, \textit{US1} and \textit{US2}, and one European survey, \textit{Eu}. The \textit{Global} survey was conducted from March 2021 to March 2022 on 40,680 respondents from 20 countries (with 1,465 to 2,488 respondents per country). \textit{US1} collected responses from 3,000 respondents between January and March 2023, while \textit{US2} gathered data from 2,000 respondents between March and April 2023. \textit{Eu} included 3,000 respondents and was conducted from February to March 2023. We used the survey companies \emph{Dynata} and \emph{Respondi}. To ensure representative samples, we employed stratified quotas based on gender, age (5 brackets), income (4), region (4), education level (3), and ethnicity (3) for the U.S. We also incorporated survey weights throughout the analysis to account for any remaining imbalances. These weights were constructed using the quota variables as well as the degree of urbanity, and trimmed between 0.25 and 4. Stratified quotas followed by reweighting is the usual method to reduce selection bias from opt-in online panels, when better sampling methods (such as compulsory participation of random dwellings) are unavailable.\cite{scherpenzeel_how_2010} By applying weights, the results are fully representative of the respective countries along the above mentioned dimensions. %. 
Results at the European level apply different weights which ensure  representativeness of the combined four European countries. Appendix \ref{app:representativeness} shows how our samples compare to actual population frequencies. Our samples match well actual frequencies, except for some imbalance on vote in the U.S. (which does not affect our results, as show the results reweighted by vote in the below section \textit{Support for the GCS}). % confirms that our samples are representative of the population. %\footnote{We trim weights so that no respondent receives a weight below 0.25 or above 4. Overall, trimming changes the weights for xx\% of the respondents.} 
% TODO? that our samples closely match population frequencies in high-income countries. In middle-income countries, the samples are only representative of the online population (young, graduated and urban people are over-represented).
Appendix \ref{app:balance} shows that the treatment branches are balanced. Appendix \ref{app:placebo} runs placebo tests of the effects of each treatment on unrelated outcomes. We do not find effects of earlier treatments on unrelated outcomes arriving later in the survey. Appendix \ref{app:extended} shows that our results are robust to including inattentive respondents.

\paragraph{\small Data quality.} % NCCcomment
The median duration is 28 minutes for the \textit{Global} survey, 14 min for \textit{US1}, 11 min for \textit{US2}, and 20 min for \textit{Eu}. To ensure the best possible data quality, we exclude respondents who fail an attention test or rush through the survey (i.e., answer in less than 11.5 minutes in the \textit{Global} survey, 4 minutes in \textit{US1} or \textit{US2}, 6 minutes in \textit{Eu}). %All the results and analyses use survey weights, defined to make the results fully representative of the country (or of Eu in the case of results at the Eu level) along the quota variables. Weights are trimmed to be between .25 and 4. 
%\textit{Ex post}, we checked that there were only a few careless response patterns (such as choosing the same answer for all items in a matrix of questions; see Appendix \ref{app:data_quality}). 
At the end of the survey, we ask whether respondents thought that our survey was politically biased and provide some feedback. 67\% of the respondents found the survey unbiased. 25\% found it left-wing biased, and 8\% found it right-wing biased.



% \subsection*{\small Questionnaires and raw results.} % WPcomment
\paragraph{\small Questionnaires and raw results.} % NCCcomment
% Possible confusion in the questionnaire: people confuse GCS with the four policies together (so support for GCS can suffer from dislike of death penalty), although this confusion is mitigating by the fact that we right after ask about NR; people may answer about revenue-use rather than the whole measure for ETS2 support; people may answer that GCS will or will not have the effects proposed rather than these effects being important or not in their attitude towards GCS; they may answer that it's important that others (not them) get more information; the minimum wage could be reduced at 50% of local median wage.
The questionnaire and raw results of the \textit{Global} survey can be found in the Appendix of the companion paper.\citep{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022} %.\cite{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022} 
The raw results are reported in Appendix \ref{app:raw_results} while the surveys' structures and questionnaires are given in Appendices \ref{app:questionnaire_oecd} and \ref{app:questionnaire}. Country-specific raw results are also available as supplementary material files:  \href{https://github.com/bixiou/international_attitudes_toward_global_policies/raw/main/paper/app_desc_stats_US.pdf}{US}, \href{https://github.com/bixiou/international_attitudes_toward_global_policies/raw/main/paper/app_desc_stats_EU.pdf}{EU}, \href{https://github.com/bixiou/international_attitudes_toward_global_policies/raw/main/paper/app_desc_stats_FR.pdf}{FR}, \href{https://github.com/bixiou/international_attitudes_toward_global_policies/raw/main/paper/app_desc_stats_DE.pdf}{DE}, \href{https://github.com/bixiou/international_attitudes_toward_global_policies/raw/main/paper/app_desc_stats_ES.pdf}{ES}, \href{https://github.com/bixiou/international_attitudes_toward_global_policies/raw/main/paper/app_desc_stats_UK.pdf}{UK}. The questionnaires are the same as the ones given \textit{ex ante} in the registration plan (\href{https://osf.io/fy6gd}{osf.io/fy6gd}).


% \subsection*{\small Incentives.} % WPcomment
\paragraph{\small Incentives.} % NCCcomment
To encourage accurate and truthful responses, several questions of the \textit{US1} survey use incentives. For each of the three comprehension questions that follow the policy descriptions, we randomly select and reward three respondents who provide correct answers with a \$50 gift certificate. Similarly, for questions involving estimating support shares for the GCS and NR, three respondents with the closest guesses to the actual values receive a \$50 gift certificate. In the donation lottery question, we randomly select one respondent and split the \$100 prize between the NGO GiveDirectly and the winner according to the winner's choice. In total, our incentives scheme distributes gift certificates (and donations) for a value of \$850. Finally, respondents have an incentive to answer truthfully to the petition question, as they are aware that the results for that question (the share of respondents supporting the policy) will be transmitted to their head of state's office.

%To encourage respondents to answer accurately and truthfully, several questions of the \textit{US1} survey use incentives. For each of the three comprehension questions that follow the policies' descriptions, we reward three (randomly drawn) respondents with the correct answer with a \$50 gift certificate. For each of the questions asking respondents to guess the share of support for the GCS and NR, we reward three people who are closest to the true value with a \$50 gift certificate. For the donation lottery question, we randomly draw one respondent and split the \$100 prize between the NGO GiveDirectly and the winner according to the winner's choice. In total, our incentives scheme distributes gift certificates (and donation) for a value of \$850. Finally, respondents have an incentive to answer truthfully to the petition question, given that they know that the results to that question (the share of respondents supporting the policy) will be transmitted to the U.S. President's office.

\paragraph{\small Absolute vs. relative support.}
In most questions, support or opposition for a policy is asked using a 5-Likert scale, with \textit{Indifferent} as the middle option and compulsory response. We call \textit{absolute support} the share of \textit{Somewhat} or \textit{Strong support}. We generally favor the notion of \textit{relative support}, which reports the share of support after excluding \textit{Indifferent} answers. Indeed, the \textit{relative support} is better suited to assess whether there is more people in favor vs. against a policy.

\paragraph{\small Support for the GCS.} 
The 95\% confidence intervals are $[52.4\%, 55.9\%]$ in the U.S. and $[74.2\%, 77.2\%]$ in Europe. The average support is computed with survey weights, employing weights based on quota variables, which exclude vote. Another method to reweigh the raw results involves running a regression of the support for the GCS on sociodemographic characteristics (including vote) and multiplying each coefficient by the population frequencies. This alternative approach yields similar figures: 76\% in Europe and 52\% or 53\% in the U.S. (depending on whether individuals who did not disclose their vote are classified as non-voters or excluded). Notably, the average support excluding non-voters is 54\% in the U.S. 

Though the level of support for the GCS is significantly lower in swing States (at 51\%) that are key to win U.S. elections, the electoral effect of endorsing the GCS remains non-significantly different from zero (at +1.2 p.p.) in these States. Note that we define swing states as the 8 states with less than 5 p.p. margin of victory in the 2020 election (MI, NV, PA, WI, AZ, GA, NC, FL). The results are robust to using the 3 p.p. threshold (that excludes FL) instead. 

\paragraph{\small List experiment.}
List experiments have been used to reveal social desirability bias, silencing either racism in the Southern U.S.\citep{kuklinski_racial_1997} or opposition to the invasion of Ukraine in Russia.\citep{chapkovski_solid_2022} % TODO? remove?
In our case, the question reads: ``Beware, this question is quite unusual. Among the policies below, \textbf{how many} do you support?'' The list of policies randomly varies across respondents, and includes a subset of GCS, NR (National Redistribution scheme), C (``Coal exit'' in the U.S., ``Thermal insulation plan'' in Europe) and O (``Marriage only for opposite-sex couples in the U.S.'', ``Death penalty for major crimes'' in Europe). There are four branches: GCS/NR/C/O; GCS/C/O; NR/C/O; C/O. To estimate the tacit average support for the GCS and NR, we regress the number of supported policies on indicators that the list includes GCS and NR.
We utilize the difference-in-means estimator, and confidence intervals are computed using Monte Carlo simulation with the R package \textit{list}.\citep{imai_multivariate_2011}

\paragraph{\small Petition.}
The respondent is randomly assigned a branch where the petition relates to the GCS or the National Redistribution scheme. The question reads: ``Would you be willing to sign a petition for the [Global climate / National redistribution] scheme? \\ As soon as the survey is complete, we will send the results to [the U.S. President's office], informing him what share of American people are willing to endorse the [Global climate / National redistribution] scheme. (You will NOT be asked to sign, only your answer here is required and remains anonymous.)''. 

Paired weighted \textit{t}-tests are conducted to test the equality in support for a policy among respondents who were questioned about the policy in the petition.

\paragraph{\small Conjoint analyses.}
The first conjoint analysis suggests that the GCS is supported independently of being complemented by the National Redistribution Scheme and a national climate policy (``Coal exit'' in the U.S., ``Thermal insulation plan'' in Europe, denoted C). Indeed, 54\% of %($n$ = 3,000) 
U.S. respondents and 74\% of %($n$ = 3,000) 
European ones prefer the combination of C, NR and the GCS to the combination of C and NR alone, indicating similar support for the GCS conditional on NR and C than for the GCS alone (Figure \ref{fig:conjoint}). 

In the second conjoint analysis, results from the first branch show that the support for the GCS conditional on NR, at 55\% in the U.S. ($n$ = 757) and 77\% in Europe ($n$ = 746), is not significantly different from the support for the GCS alone. This suggests that rejection of the GCS is not driven by the cost of the policy on oneself. The second branch shows that the support for C conditional on NR is somewhat higher, at 62\% in the U.S. ($n$ = 751) and 84\% in Europe ($n$ = 747). However, the third one shows no significant preference for C compared to GCS (both conditional on NR), neither in Europe, where GCS is preferred by 52\% ($n$ = 741) nor in the U.S., where C is preferred by 53\% ($n$ = 721). The fourth branch shows that 55\% in the U.S. ($n$ = 771) and 77\% in Europe ($n$ = 766) prefer the combination of C, NR and the GCS to NR alone.

The effects reported in the fourth analysis are the Average Marginal Component Effects.\cite{hainmueller_causal_2014} The policies studied are progressive policies prominent in the country. Except for the category \textit{foreign policy}, which features the GCS 42\% of the time, they are drawn uniformly.

\paragraph{\small Prioritization.}
The prioritization allows inferring individual-level preferences for one policy over another. This slightly differs from a conjoint analysis, which only allows inferring individual-level preferences for one platform over another or collective-level preferences for one policy over another. Also, by comparing platforms, conjoint analyses may be subject to interaction effects between policies of a platform (which can be seen as complementary, subsitute, or antagonistic) while the prioritization frames the policies as independent.

This question sheds light on a potential discrepancy between the policy priorities of the public and those enacted by legislators. For instance, while the European Union and California have enacted plans to phase out new combustion-engine cars by 2035, the proposal to ``ban the sale of new combustion-engine cars by 2030'' emerged as one of the three least prioritized policies in each country, with an average allocation of 7.8 points in France to 11.4 points in the UK.

\paragraph{\small Open-ended question on the GCS.}
Around one in four respondents explicitly cites pros or cons. Few individuals explicitly express support or opposition, and misunderstandings are rare. Only 11\% of the responses are empty or express a lack of opinion, though one-quarter are unclassifiable due to the rarity, nonsensical nature, or irrelevance of the conveyed idea.

\paragraph{\small Pros and cons.}
In the closed question, he least important aspect was the negative impact on their household, with 60\% in Europe ($n$=1,505) and 75\% in the U.S. ($n$=493) finding it important. The most important elements differ between Europe and the U.S. In Europe, the key factors are the GCS's potential to limit climate change and reduce poverty in low-income countries, both deemed important by 85\% of respondents. In the U.S., having sufficient information about the scheme ranks highest at 89\%, followed by its potential to foster global cooperation at 82\%. 

Surprisingly, the support for National Redistribution also decreased by 7 p.p. following the closed question about the GCS. This suggests that some individuals may lack attention and confuse the two policies, or that contemplating the pros and cons alters the mood of some people, moving them away from their initial positive impression.

\paragraph{\small Global wealth tax estimates.}
A 2\% tax on net wealth exceeding \$5 million would annually raise \$816 billion, leaving unaffected 99.9\% of the world population. More specifically, it would collect \euro{}5 billion in Spain, \euro{}16 billion in France, £20 billion in the UK, \euro{}44 billion in Germany, \$430 billion in the U.S., and \$1 billion collectively in all low-income countries (28 countries, home to 700 million people). These Figures come from the \href{https://wid.world/world-wealth-tax-simulator/}{WID wealth tax simulator}.\cite{chancel_world_2022}

% \paragraph{\small Swing states.}
% We define swing states as the 8 states with less than 5 p.p. margin of victory in the 2020 election (MI, NV, PA, WI, AZ, GA, NC, FL). The results are robust to using the 3 p.p. threshold (that excludes FL) instead.
% Here is a description of a specific method used.  Note that the subsection heading ends with a full stop (period) and that the command is \verb|\subsection{}| not \verb|\subsection**{}|.

\paragraph{\small Design choices.}

As Global survey results indicated strong support for global redistributive policies worldwide, we conducted our Main surveys to test the robustness of these results. %We selected five high-income countries based on their size and their level of support for global redistributive policies observed in the Global survey. 
Among the eight largest high-income countries, we selected the five ones with a relatively low level of support for global redistributive policies as observed in the Global survey. We also focus on the GCS as its costs are less concentrated on the very rich, compared to other global redistributive policies, so we expect lower (or less genuine) support. By selecting countries that would lose from global redistribution, are less supportive than others, and focusing on less consensual policies, we aimed at conservatively assessing the level of support of world citizens for global redistribution. 

We split the U.S. survey into two waves to test the effect on the support of providing the information on the actual support, and merged the \textit{Eu} survey in one wave to get larger sample sizes and more power in the analyses. 

To select the policies tested, we spanned three key areas for global redistribution: climate change, inequality, and global governance. We selected policies that are either on the agenda of international negotiations (international transfers for mitigation; adaptation; or loss and damages; cancellation of public debt; reform of voting rights at the UN or IMF; global wealth tax) or advocated by prominent NGOs or scholars (global asset registry;\citep{icrict_roadmap_2020} limits on wealth;\citep{robeyns_limitarianism_2024,piketty_brief_2022} democratic climate governance;\citep{dryzek_global_2011} global minimum wage;\citep{palley_financial_2013} fair trade;\citep{hickel_divide_2017} carbon pricing;\citep{cramton_global_2017} increased foreign aid\citep{concord_aid_2019}).

% General comments:
% I prefer my version of the intro
% I prefer to keep all graphs
% The new wording is often less direct/simple and more sophisticated/formal. e.g. "a large majority of Americans expressed that more help is needed" vs. "a significant majority of Americans emphasized the need for increased assistance". Not sure it's always better to be too formal. It is often less clear, and I think it add lengths. e.g. "In our conjoint analyses, we ask respondents to make five choices between pairs of political platforms." vs. "In order to assess the public support for the GCS in conjunction with other policies, we conducted a series of conjoint analyses. We asked respondents to make five choices between pairs of political platforms."
