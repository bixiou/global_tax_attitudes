Ideally, how should countries bear the costs of fighting climate change?''. Instead of the equal right per capita, the item was ``Countries should pay in proportion to their current emissions'', historical responsibilities was worded as ``Countries should pay in proportion to their past emissions (from 1990 onwards)'', then there was an item ``The richest countries should pay it all'', and compensating vulnerable countries was worded as ``The richest countries should pay even more, to help vulnerable countries face adverse consequences: vulnerable countries would then receive money instead of paying''.

To respect the global carbon budget, countries that emit more than their national share would pay a fee to countries that emit less than their share. \\ 
Do you support such a policy? [\textit{Figures \ref{fig:oecd} and \ref{fig:oecd_absolute}}]

\\ \textit{The emission share of a country should be proportional to its population, so that each human has an equal right to emit.; The emission share of a country should be proportional to its current emissions, so that those who already emit more have more rights to emit.; Countries that have emitted more over the past decades (from 1990 onwards) should receive a lower emission share, because they have already used some of their fair share.; Countries that will be hurt more by climate change should receive a higher emission share, to compensate them for the damages.}

Ideally, how should countries bear the costs of fighting climate change?

\item Countries should pay in proportion to their income
\item Countries should pay in proportion to their current emissions [Used as a substitute to the equal right per capita in Figure \ref{fig:oecd}]
\item Countries should pay in proportion to their past emissions (from 1990 onwards) [Used as a substitute to historical responsibilities in Figure \ref{fig:oecd}]
\item The richest countries should pay it all, so that the poorest countries do not have to pay anything
\item The richest countries should pay even more, to help vulnerable countries face adverse consequences: vulnerable countries would then receive money instead of paying [Used as a substitute to compensating vulnerable countries in Figures \ref{fig:oecd} and \ref{fig:oecd_absolute}]

\\ \textit{Strongly oppose; Somewhat oppose; Neither support nor oppose; Somewhat support; Strongly support}
\item Imagine the following policy: a global tax on greenhouse gas emissions funding a global basic income. 
Such a policy would progressively raise the price of fossil fuels (for example, the price of gasoline would increase by [40 cents per gallon] in the first years). Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Revenues from the tax would be used to finance a basic income of [\$30] per month to each human adult, thereby lifting the 700 million people who earn less than \$2/day out of extreme poverty. 
The average British person would lose a bit from this policy as they would face [\$130] per month in price increases, which is higher than the [\$30] they would receive.

\section{Net gains from the Global Climate Scheme}\label{app:gain_gcs}

To specify the GCS, we use the IEA's 2DS scenario \citep{iea_energy_2017}, which is consistent with limiting the global average temperature increase to 2\textdegree{}C with a probability of at least 50\%. The paper by \citet{hood_input_2017} contributing to the Report of the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices \citep{stern_report_2017} presents a price corridor compatible with this emissions scenario, from which we take the midpoint. The product of these two series provides an estimate of the revenues expected from a global carbon price. We then use the UN median scenario of future population aged over 15 years (\textit{adults}, for short). We derive the basic income that could be paid to all adults by recycling the revenues from the global carbon price: evolving between \$20 and \$30 per month, with a peak in 2030. Accounting for the lower price levels in low-income countries, an additional income of \$30 per month would allow \href{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY}{670 million people} to escape extreme poverty, defined with the threshold of \$2.15 per day in purchasing power parity.\footnote{By taking the \href{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.PPPC.RF}{ratio} of the World Bank series relating the GDP per capita of Sub-Saharan Africa in \href{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD?locations=ZG&year_high_desc=true}{PPP} and \href{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD?locations=ZG&year_high_desc=true}{nominal}, we obtain the purchasing power of \$1 in this region: \$2.4 in 2019. %See also the price level ratio of PPP conversion factor to market exchange rate.
} 

To estimate the increase in fossil fuel expenditures (or ``cost'') in each country by 2030, we make a key assumption concerning the evolution of the carbon footprints per adult: that they will decrease by the same proportion %$\rho$ 
in each country. We use data from the Global Carbon Project \citep{peters_synthesis_2012}. 
% Noting $e_c$ (resp. $e_c^b$) the carbon footprint per adult of a country $c$ in 2030 (resp. in baseline year $b$), we have $e_c = \rho e_c^b$. Noting $a_c$ (resp. $a_c^b$) the adult population of a country $c$ in 2030 (resp. in baseline year $b$) and $E = \sum_c e_c a_c$ global emissions in 2030, we find $\rho = \frac{E}{\sum_c e_c^b a_c}$. Finally, the average cost per adult in year $y$ is $p \cdot e_c \frac{a_c}{a^y_c}$. %Multiplying country $c$'s carbon footprint per capita with the carbon price $p$ yields its average cost per adult: $p \cdot e_c$. %$\frac{s_c^y}{p^y_c} R$. 
In 2030, the average carbon footprint of a country $c$, $e_c$, evolves from baseline year $b$ proportionally to the evolution of its adult population $\Delta p_c = p^{2030}_c/p^b_c$. Thus, the global share of country $c$'s carbon footprint, $s_c$, is proportional to $\sigma_c = e_c \Delta p_c$, and as countries' shares sum to 1, $s_c = \frac{\sigma_c}{\sum_k \sigma_k}$. Multiplying country $c$'s emission share with global revenues in 2030, $R$, and dividing by $c$'s adult population in year $y$, yields its average cost per adult: $R \cdot s_c / p^y_c$. %$\frac{s_c^y}{p^y_c} R$. 
Using findings from \citet{ivanova_unequal_2020} for Europe and \citet{fremstad_impact_2019} for the U.S., we approximate the median cost as 90\% of the average cost. Finally, the net gain is given by the basic income (\$30 per month) minus the cost. We provided consistent estimates of net gains in all surveys (using $y = b = 2015$), though in the global survey we gave the average net gains vs. the median ones in the complementary surveys. The latter are shown in Figure \ref{fig:median_gain_2015}. 
For the record, Table \ref{tab:gain_gcs.tex} also provides an estimate of \textit{average} net gains (computed with $b = 2019$ and $y = 2030$).\footnote{2015 was the last year of data available when the global questionnaire was conceived (\href{https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=IO_GHG_2019}{OECD data} was then used -- it does not cover all countries but give identical rounded estimates than those recomputed from the Global Carbon Project data for our complementary surveys). 2030 was chosen as the reference year as it is the date at which global carbon price revenues are expected to peak (and the GCS redistributive effects would be largest), and the GCS could not realistically enter into force before that date. In the surveys, we chose $y = b = 2015$ rather than $b = 2019$ and $y = 2030$ to get more conservative estimates of the monthly cost in the U.S. (\$20 higher than the other option) and in Europe (\euro{5} or Â£10 higher).}% TODO? remove footnote?

Estimates of the net gains from the Global Climate Scheme are necessarily imprecise, given the uncertainties surrounding the carbon price required to achieve emissions reductions as well as each country's trajectory in terms of emissions and population. These values are highly dependent on future (non-price) climate policies, technical progress, and economic growth of each country, which are only partially known. Integrated Assessment Models have been used to derive a Global Energy Assessment \citep{johansson_global_2012}, a 100\% renewable scenario \citep{greenpeace_energy_2015} as well as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), which include consistent trajectories of population, emissions, and carbon price \citep{riahi_shared_2017,bauer_shared_2017,van_vuuren_energy_2017,fricko_marker_2017}. Instead of using some of these modelling trajectories, we relied on a simple and transparent formula, for a number of reasons. First and foremost, those trajectories describe territorial emissions while we need consumption-based emissions to compute the incidence of the GCS. Second, the carbon price is relatively low in trajectories of SSPs that contain global warming below 2\textdegree{}C (less than \$35/tCO$_\text{2}$ in 2030), so we conservatively chose a method yielding a higher carbon price (\$90 in 2030). Third, modelling results are available only for a few macro regions, while we wanted country by country estimates. Finally, we have checked that the emissions per capita given by our method are broadly in line with alternative methods, even if it tends to overestimate net gains in countries which will decarbonize less rapidly than average.\footnote{Computations with alternative methods can be found on \href{https://github.com/bixiou/global_tax_attitudes/blob/main/code_global/map_GCS_incidence.R}{our public repository}.} For example, although countries' decarbonization plans should realign with the GCS in place, India might still decarbonize less quickly than the European Union, so India's gain and the EU's loss might be overestimated in our computations. For a more sophisticated version of the Global Climate Scheme which includes participation mechanisms preventing middle-income countries (like China) to lose from it and estimations of the Net Present Value by country, see \citet{fabre_global_2023}.  \hfill (Back~to~Section~\ref{box:GCS})
