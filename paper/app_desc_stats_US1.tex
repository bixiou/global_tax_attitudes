\subsection*{Global climate scheme}
\begin{enumerate}[resume] \item[] In the following, we describe two policies, on which we will survey your opinion. To check that you have attentively read the descriptions,~\textbf{we will ask some understanding questions afterwards: those who get correct answers can win up to \$150}. \\
\textbf{\underbar{Global climate scheme:}}~ At the Paris agreement in 2015, all countries have agreed to contain global warming ``well below +2 $\mathrm{{}^\circ}$C''. To limit global warming to this level,~\textbf{there is a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit globally}.\\
To meet the climate target, a limited number of permits to emit greenhouse gases can be created globally. Polluting firms would be required to buy permits to cover their emissions. Such a policy would~\textbf{make fossil fuel companies pay}~for their emissions and progressively raise the price of fossil fuels.~\textbf{Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.}\\
In accordance with the principle that each human has an equal right to pollute, the revenues generated by the sale of permits could finance a global basic income.~\textbf{Each adult in the world would receive \$30/month}, thereby lifting out of extreme poverty the 700 million people who earn less than \$2/day.\\
\textbf{The typical American would lose out financially \$85 per month}~(as he or she would face \$115 per month in price increases, which is higher than the \$30 they would receive). The policy could be put in place as soon as countries totaling more than 60\% of global emissions agree on it. Countries that would refuse to take part in the policy could face sanctions (like tariffs) from the rest of the World and would be excluded from the basic income.
\item \label{q:understood_gcs} Who would win or lose financially in the Global climate scheme? [\textit{Figure \ref{fig:understood_each}}] \\
\\
Three respondents with the expected answer will get \$50 in points.
\\ \textit{Typical Americans would win and the 700 million poorest humans would win.; Typical Americans would win and the 700 million poorest humans would lose.; Typical Americans would lose and the 700 million poorest humans would win.; Typical Americans would lose and the 700 million poorest humans would lose.}
\item[[new page\!\!\!]] For your information, the expected answer was \textit{Typical Americans would lose and the 700 million poorest humans would win} from the Global climate scheme. Now, here is the second policy: \\ 
\\
Now, here is the second policy:  \textbf{\underbar{National redistribution scheme:}} This policy would \textbf{increase taxes on the top 5\%} and provide cash transfers to all adults. More precisely, \textbf{each American adult would receive \$85 per month} (that is \$1,000 per year). This would be financed by an increase of the federal income tax on household income in excess of \$315,000 per year, leaving taxes unchanged for income below \$315,000. \underbar{See more details}.
\item \label{q:understood_nr} Who would win or lose financially in the National redistribution? [\textit{Figure \ref{fig:understood_each}}] \\
\\
Three respondents with the expected answer will get \$50 in points.
\\ \textit{Typical Americans would win and the richest Americans would win.; Typical Americans would win and the richest Americans would lose.; Typical Americans would lose and the richest Americans would win.; Typical Americans would lose and the richest Americans would lose.}
\item[[new page\!\!\!]] For your information, the expected answer was \textit{Typical Americans would win and the richest Americans would lose} from the National redistribution scheme. \\ 
\\
To help you with the next question, here is a reminder of the policies:\\
\\
\textbf{\underbar{Global Climate scheme:}}\\ 
To limit global warming and reach the international climate objective, the Global climate scheme would \textbf{impose a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit globally}.\\
It would \textbf{make polluters pay} for their emissions, which in turn would increase fossil fuel prices and discourage polluting activities.\\
The revenues would finance a \textbf{global basic income} of \$30 per month for all humans, lifting out of extreme poverty the poorest billion people.\\
Considering the basic income and the fuel price increases, \textbf{the typical American would lose out financially \$85 per month}.\\
\\
\textbf{\underbar{National redistribution scheme:}} This policy would \textbf{increase taxes on the top 5\%} and provide cash transfers to all adults. More precisely, \textbf{each American would receive \$85 per month}. This would be financed by an increase of the federal income tax on household income in excess of \$315,000 per year, leaving taxes unchanged for income below \$315,000 per year.
\item \label{q:understood_both} If both the Global climate scheme and the National redistribution scheme are implemented, how would a typical American be financially affected? [\textit{Figure \ref{fig:understood_each}}] \\
Three respondents with the expected answer will get \$50 in points.
\\ \textit{A typical American would lose out financially.; A typical American would neither gain nor lose.; A typical American would gain financially.}
\item[[new page\!\!\!]] For your information, the expected answer was that \textit{A typical American would neither gain nor lose} from both schemes combined. Now, here are the last two policies:\\
\\
\textbf{\underbar{Coal exit:}} To reduce CO2~emissions, this policy would require all U.S. coal power plants to be phased out by 2030. Coal would be replaced by renewable sources like wind and solar panels as well as stronger reliance on gas power plants.\\
\\
\textbf{\underbar{Marriage only for opposite-sex couples:}}\\
This policy is a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would legally define marriage as a union of one man and one woman.\\
\\
Now, we will ask your opinion on the four policies.\\
\underbar{Click here for the reminder of the first two policies.} [\textit{Clicking displays the previous summarized descriptions.}]
\item \label{q:gcs_support} Do you support the Global climate scheme? [\textit{Figure \ref{fig:support_binary}}]
\\ \textit{Yes; No}
\item \label{q:gcs_belief} According to you, what percentage of Americans answer Yes to the previous question? [\textit{Figure \ref{fig:belief}}]\\
The three people who are closest to the true value get \$50 in panel points.

\section{Net gains from the Global Climate Scheme}\label{app:gain_gcs}

To specify the GCS, we use the IEA's 2DS scenario \citep{iea_energy_2017}, which is consistent with limiting the global average temperature increase to 2\textdegree{}C with a probability of at least 50\%. The paper by \citet{hood_input_2017} contributing to the Report of the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices \citep{stern_report_2017} presents a price corridor compatible with this emissions scenario, from which we take the midpoint. The product of these two series provides an estimate of the revenues expected from a global carbon price. We then use the UN median scenario of future population aged over 15 years (\textit{adults}, for short). We derive the basic income that could be paid to all adults by recycling the revenues from the global carbon price: evolving between \$20 and \$30 per month, with a peak in 2030. Accounting for the lower price levels in low-income countries, an additional income of \$30 per month would allow \href{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY}{670 million people} to escape extreme poverty, defined with the threshold of \$2.15 per day in purchasing power parity.\footnote{By taking the \href{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.PPPC.RF}{ratio} of the World Bank series relating the GDP per capita of Sub-Saharan Africa in \href{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD?locations=ZG&year_high_desc=true}{PPP} and \href{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD?locations=ZG&year_high_desc=true}{nominal}, we obtain the purchasing power of \$1 in this region: \$2.4 in 2019. %See also the price level ratio of PPP conversion factor to market exchange rate.
} 

To estimate the increase in fossil fuel expenditures (or ``cost'') in each country by 2030, we make a key assumption concerning the evolution of the carbon footprints per adult: that they will decrease by the same proportion in each country. We use data from the Global Carbon Project \citep{peters_synthesis_2012}. In 2030, the average carbon footprint of a country $c$, $e_c$, evolves from baseline year $b$ proportionally to the evolution of its adult population $\Delta p_c = p^{2030}_c/p^b_c$. Thus, the global share of country $c$'s carbon footprint in year $y$, $s_c$, is proportional to $\sigma_c = e^y_c \Delta p_c$, and as countries' shares sum to 1, $s_c = \frac{\sigma_c}{\sum_k \sigma_k}$. Multiplying country $c$'s emission share with global revenues in 2030, $R$, and dividing by $c$'s adult population in year $y$, yields its average cost per adult: $\frac{s_c}{p^y_c} R$. Using findings from \citet{ivanova_unequal_2020} for Europe and \citet{fremstad_impact_2019} for the U.S., we approximate the median cost as 90\% of the average cost. Finally, the net gain is given by the basic income (\$30 per month) minus the cost. We provided consistent estimates of net gains in all surveys (using $y = b = 2015$), though in the global survey we gave the average net gains vs. the median ones in the complementary surveys. The latter are shown in Figure \ref{fig:median_gain_2015}. 
For the record, Table \ref{tab:gain_gcs.tex} also provides an estimate of \textit{average} net gains (computed with $b = 2019$ and $y = 2030$).\footnote{2015 was the last year of data available when the global questionnaire was conceived (\href{https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=IO_GHG_2019}{OECD data} was then used -- it does not cover all countries but give identical rounded estimates than those recomputed from the Global Carbon Project data for our complementary surveys). 2030 was chosen as the reference year as it is the date at which global carbon price revenues are expected to peak (and the GCS redistributive effects would be largest), and the GCS could not realistically enter into force before that date. In the surveys, we chose $y = b = 2015$ rather than $b = 2019$ and $y = 2030$ to get more conservative estimates of the monthly cost in the U.S. (\$20 higher than the other option) and in Europe (\euro{5} or £10 higher).}% TODO? remove footnote?

Estimates of the net gains from the Global Climate Scheme are necessarily imprecise, given the uncertainties surrounding the carbon price required to achieve emissions reductions as well as each country's trajectory in terms of emissions and population. These values are highly dependent on future (non-price) climate policies, technical progress, and economic growth of each country, which are only partially known. Integrated Assessment Models have been used to derive a Global Energy Assessment \citep{johansson_global_2012}, a 100\% renewable scenario \citep{greenpeace_energy_2015} as well as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), which include consistent trajectories of population, emissions, and carbon price \citep{riahi_shared_2017,bauer_shared_2017,van_vuuren_energy_2017,fricko_marker_2017}. Instead of using some of these modelling trajectories, we relied on a simple and transparent formula, for a number of reasons. First and foremost, those trajectories describe territorial emissions while we need consumption-based emissions to compute the incidence of the GCS. Second, the carbon price is relatively low in trajectories of SSPs that contain global warming below 2\textdegree{}C (less than \$35/tCO$_\text{2}$ in 2030), so we conservatively chose a method yielding a higher carbon price (\$90 in 2030). Third, modelling results are available only for a few macro regions, while we wanted country by country estimates. Finally, we have checked that the emissions per capita given by our method are broadly in line with alternative methods, even if it tends to overestimate net gains in countries which will decarbonize less rapidly than average.\footnote{Computations with alternative methods can be found on \href{https://github.com/bixiou/global_tax_attitudes/blob/main/code_global/map_GCS_incidence.R}{our public repository}.} For example, although countries' decarbonization plans should realign with the GCS in place, India might still decarbonize less quickly than the European Union, so India's gain and the EU's loss might be overestimated in our computations.
