% Draft: 6200 words (excl. abstract, methods, appendix), incl. 5.2k in Results.
% Current: 5600 words (excl. abstract, methods, appendix), incl. 4.6k in Results.
% Old: 4300 words (excl. abstract, methods, appendix) + 3 medium-large figures (equivalent, I know it's 4) => correct size
% => write a 2-3 pager (1000 words with 2 figures and one-sentence abstract) on Word with Science's template, send it as submission enquiry to Nature (as one can't send full paper); then for Policy forum in Science.
% => write full paper as a 6-page (2500 words*) in LaTeX or Word so it can fit in PNAS, and even for NCC/NS it shouldn't exceed 8-9-page. (It's already too long for Science's max 5 page).
% *6-page is more 5000 than 2500 words.

Case & Deaton (PNAS, 21) is also 5k words for 5p (excl abstract and biblio, dont 4.7k excl. the 3 medium-large figures). Bruckner et al (NS, 22): 4.3k words for 6p (excl. abstract, methods, biblio, dont 3.8k excl the 5 medium-large figures) + 3.4k in methods. => about 1k per page without figure/table.

% Nature "abstract": Major sustainability objectives could be achieved by global approaches to mitigating climate change and inequality    . For instance, a global carbon price funding a global basic income, called the “Global Climate Scheme” (GCS), would be an effective way to jointly combat climate change and poverty. A key condition for the success of global cooperation is the support of citizens in affluent countries for such globally redistributive policies. Yet, few prior attitudinal surveys have examined support for global policies. To explore relevant public attitudes, we survey over 48,000 respondents from 20 high- and middle-income countries. The responses reveal strong support for global redistributive policies, including the GCS and a global wealth tax aimed at financing low-income countries. A list experiment shows no evidence of social desirability bias in survey responses, majorities are willing to sign a real-stake petition, and global redistribution ranks high in the prioritization of policies. Conjoint analyses reveal that a political platform is more likely to be preferred if it contains the GCS or a global tax on millionaires. In sum, our findings indicate that global redistributive policies are genuinely supported by a majority of the population, even in wealthy nations that would bear a significant burden. Public opinion is therefore not the reason that they do not prominently enter political debates. These results could help draw attention to global policies in the public debate and contribute to their increased prominence.

\begin{abstract}
  % We document majority support for policies entailing global redistribution and climate mitigation. Recent surveys on 40,680 respondents in 20 countries covering 72\% of global carbon emissions show strong support for an effective way to jointly combat climate change and poverty: a global carbon price funding a global basic income, called the ``Global Climate Scheme'' (GCS). Using complementary surveys on 8,000 respondents in the U.S., France, Germany, Spain, and the UK, we test several hypotheses that could reconcile strong stated support with a lack of salience in policy circles. A list experiment shows no evidence of social desirability bias, majorities are willing to sign a real-stake petition, and global redistribution ranks high in the prioritization of policies. Conjoint analyses reveal that a platform is more likely to be preferred if it contains the GCS or a global tax on millionaires. Universalistic attitudes are confirmed by an incentivized donation. In sum, our findings indicate that global policies are genuinely supported by a majority of the population.

Recent surveys administered 
%by Dechezleprêtre et al. (2022)\cite{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022} % TODO!back
to over 40,000 respondents from 20 high- and middle-income countries reveal substantial support for those policies, especially global climate policies and a global tax on the wealthiest aimed at financing low-income countries %.\cite{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022}
(other questions from these surveys are analyzed in a companion paper\cite{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022}). 
% Using surveys over 40,000 respondents from 20 high- and middle-income countries, we document substantial support for global policies. 

To gain insights into the factors shaping public support for global policies in high-income countries, we conduct complementary surveys among 8,000 respondents from France, Germany, Spain, the U.S., and the UK. The focus of our approach is a specific policy aimed at addressing both climate change and poverty, referred to as the ``Global Climate Scheme'' (GCS). It implements a cap on carbon emissions to limit global warming below 2\textdegree{}C. The emission rights are auctioned each year to polluting firms and fund a global basic income, alleviating extreme poverty. 
In the wording of the question, respondents are made aware of the cost to themselves of such global redistribution. 
The GCS is supported by three quarters of Europeans and half of Americans. We test whether support of the expressed preference is sincere: a list experiment shows no evidence of social desirability bias in survey responses, majorities are willing to sign a real-stake petition, and global redistribution ranks high in the prioritization of policies. Conjoint analyses reveal that a political platform is more likely to be preferred if it contains the GCS or a global tax on millionaires. 
% In sum, our findings indicate that global redistributive policies are genuinely supported by a majority of the population. 

% Major sustainability objectives could be achieved by global approaches to mitigating climate change and poverty.\cite{budolfson_climate_2021,franks_mobilizing_2018,dennig_inequality_2015,soergel_combining_2021} For example, an equal per capita dividend paid out of 2 degree compatible carbon prices can improve well-being as well as reduce inequality and poverty at a national level.\cite{budolfson_climate_2021} Global carbon pricing is even more redistributive.\cite{bauer_quantification_2020} 
% However, disagreements on burden-sharing, differing priorities, and lack of institutional capacity are commonly seen as obstacles to effective global collaboration on these objectives.\cite{cramton_global_2017} We examine a key condition for the success of global cooperation, neglected in social science research so far: the support of citizens in affluent countries for globally redistributive policies.% which can deliver on poverty reduction and climate change mitigation. This article investigates public attitudes toward such global policies.

Conversely, assuming a carbon price of \$90/tCO$_\text{2}$ in 2030, high emitters like a typical American (with median U.S. CO$_\text{2}$ emissions) would lose in net \$85 per month, as they would face \$115 per month in price increases (see details in Appendix \ref{app:gain_gcs}).

% By employing a list experiment, a real-stake petition (with the question results communicated to the heads of state), and conjoint analyses, our study indicates genuine and robust support for the GCS among respondents. For example, the conjoint analyses provide evidence that political parties would not lose vote intention by endorsing the GCS, and that majorities prefer platforms that contain GCS to those that do not.% https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=XD-XM

% % On top of addressing both global poverty and climate change, we provide evidence from surveys showing that people all over the world support this policy. Yet, the GCS is nowhere to be seen in policy debates. Why? To explain this paradox (absence of the policy despite majority stated support), we further investigate rationales behind the support for the GCS and the sincerity of these claims, as well as attitudes toward other global policies, global redistribution, and universalistic values. % TODO: rework

% These findings underscore a strong demand for globally redistributive climate policies, even in the absence of significant policy proposal. In our discussion we offer potential explanations behind this policy implementation gap, indicating that public opinion does not seem to be the reason why they are rarely mentioned in public debates.


% Global cooperation is necessary to solve sustainability challenges such as poverty and climate change. Disagreements on burden-sharing, differing priorities and lack of institutional capacity are obstacles to effective global collaboration. One further obstacle, neglected in social science research so far, is the willingness of citizens in affluent countries to bear the costs of the global redistribution associated with effective poverty reduction and climate change mitigation. This article investigates public attitudes toward global policies delivering on climate change mitigation and poverty reduction.

% To explore relevant public attitudes, we use surveys administered to over 40,000 respondents from 20 high- and middle-income countries covering 72\% of global carbon emissions. The responses reveal substantial support for global policies, including global emissions trading and a global wealth tax aimed at financing low-income countries. Surprisingly, even in wealthy nations that would bear a significant burden, majorities of citizens express support for globally redistributive measures.

% To gain insights into the factors shaping public support in these countries, we conducted complementary surveys among 8,000 respondents from France, Germany, Spain, the U.S., and the UK. The focus is a specific policy aimed at addressing both climate change and extreme poverty, referred to as the ``Global Climate Scheme'' (GCS). It consists of global emissions trading, which limits total carbon emissions. The emission rights are auctioned each year to polluting firms and fund a global basic income. By employing a list experiment, a real-stake petition, and conjoint analysis, our study demonstrates the genuine and robust support for the GCS among respondents. For example, the conjoint analysis provides evidence that policymakers do not lose public support by endorsing the GCS.

% These findings underscore a strong demand for globally redistributive climate policies, even in the absence of significant policy implementation. In our discussion we offer potential explanations behind this policy implementation gap.


% Ethical theories often warrant transfers from high- to low-income people, hence from high- to low-income countries. This is the case of utilitarianism, the benchmark ethical theory used in economics. Utilitarianism assigns the same weight to each person and thus considers that a dollar is better allocated to a low-income person, which has a higher marginal utility than a high-income person.\cite{mill_utilitarianism_1861} 

% Addressing global poverty, inequalities and climate change are at the heart of the universally agreed Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). % 12 out of  17
% It has been pointed out that low-income countries generally do not have enough domestic resources to eliminate the poverty gap in the short run.\cite{bolch_arithmetics_2022} % In other words, it would hardly be possible to achieve the first SDG and end extreme poverty by 2030 without international transfers. => Careful, Bolch use a poverty line above the SDG one.

% Climate change is another issue that calls for a global response and in particular international transfers. Postulating %Assuming
% that each human has an equal right to emit CO$_\text{2}$, low emitters have a legitimate claim \textit{vis-à-vis} high emitters, that can be settled by monetary transfers. Coupling this burden-sharing principle to the carbon budget (remaining emissions that would be compatible with the Paris agreement) naturally defines a global climate policy. We call it the ``Global climate scheme'' (GCS); it consists of a global cap-and-trade system where emission rights are auctioned each year to polluting firms and the revenues finance a global basic income. Using the price and emissions trajectories from the Stern-Stiglitz report,\cite{stern_report_2017} we estimate that the basic income would amount to \$30 per month for each human above 15 in 2030, enough to lift out of extreme poverty the 700 million people who live with less than PPP \$2 per day. Conversely, high emitters like a typical American (with median U.S. CO$_\text{2}$ emissions) would lose in net \$85 per month, as they would face \$115 per month in price increases (assuming a carbon price of \$90/tCO$_\text{2}$ in 2030). % TD Give the numbers in the Results section

% If high emitters share universalistic ethical values, we expect strong support for the GCS, even in high-income countries. On the contrary, if people defend their own financial interest, we expect low support for the GCS in high-income countries. 

% In this paper, we study attitudes toward global policies that address climate change, global poverty or inequalities, with a focus on the GCS. We measure stated support for different global policies using unpublished results from a survey\cite{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022} on climate attitudes conducted in 2021 on 40,680 respondents from 20 countries covering 72\% of global CO$_\text{2}$ emissions. We then conduct a representative survey on 3,000 U.S. respondents to study in detail the sincerity and rationales behind the support for the GCS, the attitudes toward various global policies, global redistribution, and universalistic values.

% The presentation of results proceeds as follows: after briefly describing the survey data (\ref{subsec:data}), we first document broad international support for global approaches to climate policy that lead to global redistribution (\ref{subsubsec:global_support}). Subsequently, we present specific findings from surveys in the U.S. and Europe that document support for the GCS, wealth taxes, and foreign aid in those countries (\ref{subsubsec:support_gcs}-\ref{subsubsec:support_foreign_aid}). We proceed to study the support for the Global Climate Scheme in more detail, by means of a list experiment, petition, conjoint analyses, prioritization task, and by eliciting pros and cons (\ref{subsec:robustness_sincerity}). To understand the gap between support for global policies and their appearance in public discussion, we conclude by reporting results on underlying universalistic values (\ref{subsec:universalistic}) and beliefs about the support of others (\ref{subsec:second_order_beliefs}).

% \paragraph{Global Survey}

% The \textit{Global} survey, conducted in 2021, involved 40,680 respondents from 20 countries, representing approximately 72\% of global CO$_\text{2}$ emissions. This survey serves as the basis for measuring stated support for various global policies worldwide. Detailed information about the data collection process, sample representativeness, and analysis of questions on national policies can be found in our companion paper.\cite{dechezlepretre_fighting_2022}

% \paragraph{Complementary Surveys}\label{par:surveys}

% To delve deeper into the sincerity and rationales behind support for the GCS and attitudes toward global policies, global redistribution, and universalistic values, complementary surveys were conducted in 2023. These surveys are based on a sample of 8,000 respondents from France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the U.S. The European survey (\textit{Eu}) comprises 3,000 respondents, while the U.S. sample was collected in two separate waves: \textit{US1} with 3,000 respondents and \textit{US2} with 2,000 respondents. The survey questions in both the European and U.S. surveys are identical, except for an additional question in \textit{US2} that uses results from \textit{US1} to assess the bandwagon effect.

% The complementary surveys ensured representativeness along key dimensions such as gender, income, age, highest diploma, and degree of urbanization. The \textit{Eu} survey is also representative of its four countries in terms of population size, while the \textit{US1} and \textit{US2} surveys are representative in terms of region and ethnicity.

Among the four global climate policies examined in the \textit{Global} survey, three policies garner high support across all countries (Figure \ref{fig:oecd}): a global democratic assembly on climate change, a global tax on millionaires to finance low-income countries contingent on their climate action, and a global carbon budget of +2\textdegree{}C divided among countries based on tradable shares (or ``global quota''), with the allocation of country shares unspecified. %\footnote{The policies were all described with further details to make sure people understood them. Specifically, the policies were presented as follows: an international emissions trading system where ``countries that emit more than their national share would pay a fee to countries that emit less than their share''; ``a tax on all millionaires in dollars around the world to finance low-income countries that comply with international standards regarding climate action [which] would finance infrastructure and public services such as access to drinking water, healthcare, and education''; ``a global democratic assembly whose role would be to draft international treaties against climate change [where] each adult across the world would have one vote to elect members of the assembly''.} 
The three policies garner a majority of absolute support (i.e., ``somewhat'' or ``strong'' support) in all countries (except in the U.S. for the global assembly, 48\% absolute support). In high-income countries, the global quota obtains 64\% absolute support and 84\% relative support (i.e., excluding ``indifferent'' answers). 
% Support for this policy is even higher in middle-income countries, however their samples are only representative of the online population (young, graduated and urban people are over-represented).%due to the over-representation of young, educated, and urban populations in the online sample. % TODO? remove? 27 w

Following the support for the global quota, respondents are asked about their preferences for dividing the carbon budget among countries (see third block of Figure \ref{fig:oecd}). Consistent with the existing literature (see Supplementary Section A.1.2), an equal per capita allocation of emission rights emerges as the preferred burden-sharing principle, garnering absolute majority support in all countries and never below 84\% relative support. Taking into account historical responsibilities or vulnerability to climate damages is also popular, albeit with less consensus, while grandfathering (i.e., allocation of emission shares in proportion to current emissions) receives the least support in all countries.

A global quota with equal per capita emission rights should produce the same distributional outcomes as a global carbon tax that funds a global basic income. %\footnote{Similarly,  a global quota with grandfathering is equivalent to a global carbon tax where each country keeps the revenues it collects.} 
The support for the global carbon tax is also tested and its redistributive effects --  the average increase in expenditures along with the amount of the basic income -- are specified to the respondents explicitly. %: the \$30 per month basic income would lift the 700 million people who earn less than \$2/day out of extreme poverty, and fossil price increases would cost the typical person in their country a certain amount (that is provided).  % The average British person would lose a bit from this policy as they would face £42 per month in price increases, which is higher that the £22 they would receive.
The support for the carbon tax is lower than for the quota, particularly in high-income countries, and there is no relative majority for the tax in Anglo-Saxon countries. %\footnote{The levels of support are consistent with the findings of \cite{carattini_how_2019}, the only previous study that tested a global carbon tax.} 
Two possible reasons %for this lower support 
are that distributive effects are made salient in the case of the tax, and that citizens may prefer a quota, perhaps because they find it more effective than a tax to reduce emissions. This interpretation is consistent with the level of support for the global quota once we make the distributive effects salient, as we do in the complementary surveys.

% One possible reason for this discrepancy is the explicit emphasis on the redistributive effects associated with the tax in the survey. The survey informs respondents that the \$30 per month basic income would lift 700 million people earning less than \$2/day out of extreme poverty, while fossil price increases would impose costs (specified in the survey) on the typical person in their country. Although other factors such as perceptions of effectiveness may also influence support for a quota versus a tax, this interpretation aligns with the level of support for the global quota when distributive effects are made salient, as we do in the complementary surveys. 

% The remainder of the paper analyzes the results from the complementary surveys in the U.S. and in Europe. This Section covers the stated support for different global redistributive policies. %the Global Climate Scheme, a global wealth tax, other global policies, and foreign aid.

\paragraph{Global Climate Scheme}\label{subsubsec:support_gcs} % WPcomment

The complementary surveys (\textit{US1}, \textit{US2}, \textit{Eu}) consist of a comprehensive exploration of citizens' attitudes toward the GCS. We present to respondents a detailed description of the GCS and explain its distributive effects, including specific amounts at stake (see box below and Supplementary Section D). 
Furthermore, we assess respondents' understanding of the GCS with incentivized questions to test their comprehension of the expected financial outcome for typical individuals in their country (loss) and the poorest individuals globally (gain), followed by the provision of correct answer. %63\% understand the policy will make people in their country poorer, before even we indicate this as the right answer. 
That is, respondents are made aware and we find they understand that the policy will make people in their country poorer. 
The same approach is applied to a National Redistribution scheme (NR) targeting the top 5\% (in the U.S.) or top 1\% (in Europe) with the aim of financing cash transfers to all adults, %\footnote{The wider base in the U.S. was chosen because emissions are larger in the U.S. than in Europe, and it would hardly be feasible to offset the median American's loss by taxing only the top 1\%.} 
calibrated to offset the monetary loss of the GCS for the median emitter in their country. We evaluate respondents' understanding that the richest would lose and the typical fellow citizens would gain from that policy. % done We proceed the same way for a National Redistribution Scheme (NR) that would tax the top 5\% (in the U.S.) or the top 1\% (in Europe) to finance cash transfers to all adults (calibrated to offset the monetary loss of the GCS for the median emitter), expecting people to find out at the comprehension question that the richest would lose and the typical people in their country would win.
Subsequently, we summarize both schemes to enhance respondents' recall. Additionally, we present a final incentivized comprehension question and provide the expected answer that the combined GCS and NR would result in no net gain or loss for a typical fellow citizen. Finally, respondents are directly asked to express their support for the GCS and NR using a simple \textit{Yes}/\textit{No} question. % TODO? remove? shorten? 169 w


The stated support for the GCS is 54\% in the U.S. and 76\% in Europe (Figure \ref{fig:support}), %\footnote{The 95\% confidence intervals are $[52.4\%, 55.9\%]$ in the U.S. and $[74.2\%, 77.2\%]$ in Europe. The average support is computed with survey weights, employing weights based on quota variables, which exclude vote. Another method to reweigh the raw results involves running a regression of the support for the GCS on sociodemographic characteristics (including vote) and multiplying each coefficient by the population frequencies. This alternative approach yields similar figures: 76\% in Europe and 52\% or 53\% in the U.S. (depending on whether individuals who did not disclose their vote are classified as non-voters or excluded). Notably, the average support excluding non-voters is 54\% in the U.S.} 
while the support for NR is very similar: 56\% and 73\% respectively (Supplementary Figure 3). Supplementary Section F presents the sociodemographic determinants of GCS support, showing, for instance, stronger support among young people.

\begin{tcolorbox}\label{box:GCS}
  \paragraph{The Global Climate Scheme} The GCS consists of global emissions trading with emission rights being auctioned each year to polluting firms, and of a global basic income, funded by the auction revenues. Using the price and emissions trajectories from the Stern-Stiglitz report,\cite{stern_report_2017} and in particular a carbon price of \$90/tCO$_\text{2}$ in 2030, we estimate that the basic income would amount to \$30 per month for every human over the age of 15 (see details in Supplementary Section E). %, enough to lift out of extreme poverty the 700 million people who live with less than PPP \$2 per day.

\paragraph{Global wealth tax}\label{subsubsec:support_global_wealth_tax} % WPcomment

Consistent with the results of the global survey, a ``tax on millionaires of all countries to finance low-income countries'' garners absolute majority support of over 67\% in each country, only 5 p.p. lower than a national millionaires tax overall (Figure \ref{fig:support}). In random subsamples, we inquire about respondents' preferences regarding the redistribution of revenues from a global tax on individual wealth exceeding \$5 million, after providing information on the revenue raised by such a tax in their country compared to low-income countries. %\footnote{A 2\% tax on net wealth exceeding \$5 million would annually raise \$816 billion, leaving unaffected 99.9\% of the world population. More specifically, it would collect \euro{}5 billion in Spain, \euro{}16 billion in France, £20 billion in the UK, \euro{}44 billion in Germany, \$430 billion in the U.S., and \$1 billion collectively in all low-income countries (28 countries, home to 700 million people).%Figures come from \cite{chancel_world_2022}, the \href{https://wid.world/world-wealth-tax-simulator/}{WID wealth tax simulator}, and the World Bank. % TODO: do they?

We ask certain respondents ($n$ = 1,283) what percentage of global tax revenues should be pooled to finance low-income countries. In each country, at least 88\% of respondents indicate a positive amount, with an average ranging from 30\% (Germany) to 36\% (U.S., France) (Supplementary Figure 4). To other respondents ($n$ = 1,233), we inquire whether they would prefer each country to retain all the revenues it collects or that half of the revenues be pooled to finance low-income countries. Approximately half of the respondents opt to allocate half of the tax revenues to low-income countries.

Other global redistributive policies garner majority support across all countries (Figure \ref{fig:support}).
% We also assess support for other global policies (Figure \ref{fig:support}). Most policies garner relative majority support in each country, with two exceptions: the ``cancellation of low-income countries' public debt'' and ``a maximum wealth limit'' for each individual. The latter policy obtains relative majority support in Europe but not in the U.S., despite the cap being set at \$10 billion in the U.S. compared to \euro{}/£100 million in Europe. Notably, climate-related policies enjoy significant popularity, with ``high-income countries funding renewable energy in low-income countries'' receiving absolute majority support across all surveyed countries. Additionally, relative support for loss and damages compensation, as approved in principle at the international climate negotiations in 2022 (``COP27''), ranges from 55\% (U.S.) to 81\% (Spain), with absolute support ranging from 41\% to 62\%.

We provide respondents with information about the actual amount ``spent on foreign aid to reduce poverty in low-income countries'' relative to their country's government spending and GDP. Less than 16\% of respondents state that their country's foreign aid should be reduced, while 62\% express support for increasing it, including 17\% who support an unconditional increase (Supplementary Figure 5). Among the 45\% who think aid should be increased under certain conditions, we subsequently ask them to specify the conditions they deem necessary (Supplementary Figure 6). The three most commonly selected conditions are: ``we can be sure the aid reaches people in need and money is not diverted'' (73\% chose this condition), ``that recipient countries comply with climate targets and human rights'' (67\%), and ``that other high-income countries also increase their foreign aid'' (48\%). %\footnote{It is worth noting that these conditions align closely with the principles of the GCS.} 
On the other hand, respondents who do not wish to increase their country's foreign aid primarily justify their view by prioritizing the well-being of their fellow citizens or by perceiving each country as responsible for its own fate (Supplementary Figure 7). In response to an open-ended question regarding measures high-income countries should take to fight extreme poverty, a large majority of Americans expressed that more help is needed (Supplementary Figure A38). 
The most commonly suggested form of aid is financial support, closely followed by investments in education. % TOD? remove? 81 w


We also inquire about the perceived amount of foreign aid. Consistent with prior research (see Supplementary Section A.1.3), most people overestimate the actual amount of foreign aid (Supplementary Figures A17, A19). 
We then elicit respondents' preferred amount of foreign aid, after randomly presenting them with either the actual amount or no information. Most of the respondents choose a bracket at least as high as the actual amount (when the receive the information) or the perceived one (when they do not), %who learn the actual amount choose a bracket at least as high as the actual one, and most of those without the information choose a bracket at least as high as the perceived one 
see Supplementary Figures A17--A21. 
Finally, we ask a last question to the respondents who received the information. To those who prefer an increase of foreign aid, we ask how they would finance it and find that the preferred source of funding is overwhelmingly higher taxes on the wealthiest (Supplementary Figure A22). 
To those who prefer a reduction, we ask how they would use the funds becoming available: %resulting savings:

\paragraph{List experiment}\label{subsubsec:list_exp} % WPcomment

% By asking how many policies within a list respondents support, and adding for some respondents the GCS in the list, we identify the tacit support for that policy. It is not significantly different from the stated support (table S1). Hence, we do not find a social desirability bias: people faithfully report their opinion on the GCS.  % shortened

% A list experiment is employed to gauge tacit support for a specific policy of interest by asking respondents how many policies within a given list they support. By varying the list among respondents, the difference in number of policies supported can be used to estimate tacit support, revealing potential social desirability biases \cite{hainmueller_causal_2014}.
We use a list experiment to identify the tacit support for the GCS. To do so, we ask \textit{how many} policies within a list respondents support, and vary the list among respondents. The tacit support is estimated as the difference in the average number of policies supported between two random subsamples, whose list differ only by the inclusion of the GCS.\cite{hainmueller_causal_2014} %\footnote{For example, say a first subsample faces the list of policies A, B, and C, while a second subsamples faces the list A, B, C, and GCS. We do not need to know which policies each respondent support to estimate the average (tacit) support for the GCS, we simply need to compute the difference in the average number of supported policies between the two random subsamples.} % respondents who face a list containing the policy, and respondents who face the same list without it.

In our case, as shown in Table \ref{tab:list_exp}, the tacit support for the GCS measured through the list experiment is not significantly lower than the direct stated support. %\footnote{We utilize the difference-in-means estimator, and confidence intervals are computed using Monte Carlo simulation with the R package \textit{list} \cite{imai_multivariate_2011}.} 
Hence, we do not find a social desirability bias in our study.

% The tacit support for the GCS measured through the list experiment is as high as  the direct question in Eu but significantly lower by 5 p.p. in the U.S. This may be the sign of a social norm pushing some Americans to state that they support the GCS although they secretly do not. Still, if there is a social norm in favor of the GCS, there is a similar norm in favor of the National Redistribution Scheme, as the gap between the tacit and direct support for it is comparable (at 6 p.p.). %However, two observations qualify this interpretation. First, the gap between the tacit and direct support for the National Redistribution Scheme is comparable (at 7 p.p.) though we did not expect such a social norm in the case of the national redistribution, as the 95\% who would benefit from it should not feel ashamed to oppose a policy that would benefit them. Second, while we tested the questionnaire on random people in cafés, we noticed that some were confused by the question of the list experiment (asking how many policies from the list they supported), upset with the conservative societal policy (``Marriage only for opposite-sex couples in the U.S.'', ``Death penalty for major crimes'' in Europe), to the point that they did not answer attentively.

In a real-stake question, we ask respondents whether they are willing to sign a petition in support of either the GCS or NR policy, informing them that the results of that question will be sent to the head of state's office.
In the U.S., we find no significant difference between the support in the real-stake petitions and the simple questions (GCS: $p=.30$; NR: $p=.76$). %\footnote{Paired weighted \textit{t}-tests are conducted to test the equality in support for a policy among respondents who were questioned about the policy in the petition.} 
In Europe, the petition leads to a comparable lower support for both the GCS (7 p.p., $p=10^{-5}$) and NR (4 p.p., $p = .008$), but the support remains strong, at 69\% for the GCS. 
% While some European respondents are unwilling to sign a petition for policies they are expected to support, this effect is not specific to the GCS, and the overall willingness to sign a real-stake petition remains strong, with 69\% expressing support for the GCS and 67\% for NR.

To assess the public support for the GCS in conjunction with other policies, we %conduct a series of conjoint analyses. We 
ask respondents to make five choices between pairs of political platforms.

The first conjoint analysis suggests that the GCS is supported independently of being complemented by the National Redistribution Scheme and a national climate policy, denoted C.  
% (``Coal exit'' in the U.S., ``Thermal insulation plan'' in Europe, denoted C). %\footnote{Indeed, 54\% of %($n$ = 3,000) % TODO? remove? 12 w
% U.S. respondents and 74\% of %($n$ = 3,000) 
% European ones prefer the combination of C, NR and the GCS to the combination of C and NR alone, indicating similar support for the GCS conditional on NR and C than for the GCS alone (Figure \ref{fig:conjoint}).} % (as it does not significantly differ from the direct support of 53\%). 
For the second analysis, we split the sample into four random branches. %\footnote{Results from the first branch show that the support for the GCS conditional on NR, at 55\% in the U.S. ($n$ = 757) and 77\% in Europe ($n$ = 746), is not significantly different from the support for the GCS alone. This suggests that rejection of the GCS is not driven by the cost of the policy on oneself. The second branch shows that the support for C conditional on NR is somewhat higher, at 62\% in the U.S. ($n$ = 751) and 84\% in Europe ($n$ = 747). However, the third one shows no significant preference for C compared to GCS (both conditional on NR), neither in Europe, where GCS is preferred by 52\% ($n$ = 741) nor in the U.S., where C is preferred by 53\% ($n$ = 721). The fourth branch shows that 55\% in the U.S. ($n$ = 771) and 77\% in Europe ($n$ = 766) prefer the combination of C, NR and the GCS to NR alone.} 
The outcome is that there is majority support for the GCS and for C, which are seen as neither complement nor substitute (Supplementary Figure A7). A minor share of respondents like a national climate policy and dislike a global one, but as many people prefer a global rather than a national policy; and there is no evidence that implementing NR would increase the support for the GCS.

In the third analysis, we present two random branches of the sample with hypothetical progressive and conservative platforms that differ only by the presence (or not) of the GCS in the progressive platform. Table \ref{tab:conjoint_c} shows that a progressive candidate would not significantly lose voting share by endorsing the GCS in any country, and may even gain 11 p.p. ($p = .005$) in voting intention in France and 3 p.p. ($p = .13$) in the U.S. 
% The effect is also positive at 3 p.p. ($p = .13$) in the U.S., although not significant at the 5\% threshold. % France holds multiple hypotheses testing  % shortened
% Though the level of support for the GCS is significantly lower in swing States (at 51\%) that are key to win U.S. elections, the electoral effect of endorsing the GCS remains non-significantly different from zero (at +1.2 p.p.) in these States.%\footnote{We define swing states as the 8 states with less than 5 p.p. margin of victory in the 2020 election (MI, NV, PA, WI, AZ, GA, NC, FL). The results are robust to using the 3 p.p. threshold (that excludes FL) instead.} % TODO? remove? 41 w

%The third analysis suggests that a progressive candidate would not significantly lose voting share if he or she were to endorse the GCS, and that he or she may even gain 11 p.p. vote intention in France (see Table \ref{tab:conjoint_c}). To estimate this, we present to two random branches of the sample hypothetical progressive and conservative platforms that differ only by the presence (or not) of the GCS in the progressive platform.

Toward the end of the survey, we ask respondents to allocate 100 points among six randomly selected policies from the previous conjoint analyses, using sliders. The instruction was to distribute the points based on their level of support, with a higher allocation indicating greater support for a policy. %At the end of the survey, we pick six policies at random (and uniformly) among the policies used in the last conjoint analyses, and ask respondents to allocate 100 points among them (using sliders), with the instruction that ``the more you give points to a policy, the more you support it''.

% In the \textit{US2} survey, we presented these questions to random subsamples \textit{before} inquiring about support for the GCS or NR.

Interestingly, the support for the GCS decreased by 11 p.p. after participants viewed a list of its pros and cons. Surprisingly, the support for National Redistribution also decreased by 7 p.p. following the closed question about the GCS.

%Despite some significant effects of pondering the pros and cons (see Table \ref{tab:branch_gcs}), approximately half of the Americans expressed support for the GCS across all treatment branches.

In the \textit{US2} survey, we divided the sample into four random branches.

Furthermore, when we ask respondents to assess the extent to which climate change, global poverty, and inequality in their country are issues, climate change is generally viewed as the most significant problem (with a mean score of 0.59 after recoding answers between $-$2 and 2).

In Europe, we observe no significant variation in the willingness to donate based on the recipient's origin. In the U.S., the donations to Africans are 3 p.p. lower% (with an average donation of 34\%) % shortened

% Overall, answers to these broad value questions are consistent with half of Americans and three quarters of Europeans supporting global policies like the GCS: people are almost as much willing to give to poor Africans than to poor fellow citizens, find that global issues are among the biggest problems, almost half of them are universalist when they vote, and most of them wish that their diplomats take into account global justice.

\section*{Discussion} % Summary, conclusion

We provide some cautious evidence that certain global climate and redistribution policies may be popular in the Global North. We find no evidence for insincerity or underestimation of fellow citizens' support as potential explanations for the scarcity of global policies in the public debate, though support for them might decay once they are debated. New hypotheses could explain the seeming inconsistency of the high support for global policies with their peripheral appearance in the policy sphere: First, policymakers may be unaware that global policies are popular. Second, policymakers may believe that global redistribution is politically infeasible in some key countries. Third, with political discourse focused on the national level, shaped by media and elections, national framing may suppress universalistic values. 

% Having ruled out insincerity and underestimation of fellow citizens' support as potential explanations for the scarcity of global policies in the public debate, we propose different alternative explanations. 
% First, there may be pluralistic ignorance among policymakers. Second, policymakers may believe that globally redistributive policies are politically infeasible in some key countries like the U.S. Third, political discourse centrally happens at the national level, shaped by media and institutions such as voting. In turn, national framing may suppress universalistic values. 
% In any case, our findings indicate that public opinion is not the reason why global redistributive policies do not prominently enter political debates.
% National framing by political voices may create biases and suppress universalistic values. Uncovering evidence to support these hypotheses could %help
% draw attention to global policies in the public debate and contribute to their increased prominence.

% complementary surveys conducted in the U.S. and four European countries %presented here 
% reinforce these findings. We find strong support for global taxes on the wealthiest individuals, as well as majority support for our main policy of interest -- the Global Climate Scheme (GCS). The GCS encompasses carbon pricing at a global level through an emissions trading system, accompanied by a global basic income funded by the scheme's revenues. Additional experiments, such as a list experiment and a real-stake petition, demonstrate that the support for the GCS is real. 
% Such genuine support is further substantiated by the prioritization of the GCS over prominent national climate policies and aligned with a significant portion of the population holding universalistic values rather than nationalistic or egoistic ones. Moreover, the conjoint analyses indicate that a progressive candidate would not lose voting shares by endorsing the GCS, and may even gain 11 p.p. in voting shares in France. Similarly, a candidate endorsing the GCS would gain votes in a U.S. Democratic primary, while in Europe, a progressive platform that includes the GCS would be preferred over one that does not.

% %Having ruled out insincerity and underestimation of fellow citizens' support as potential explanations for the scarcity of global policies in the public debate, we propose alternative explanations. %As we ruled out all hypotheses of our registration plan,\footnote{The project was preregistered in the Open Science Foundation registry (\href{https://osf.io/fy6gd}{osf.io/fy6gd}).} we now need to study new explanations. % /!\ leave commented

% What could explain the gap between sincere support of citizens and the scarce mention in public debate? First, there may be pluralistic ignorance \textit{among policymakers} regarding universalistic values, support for global redistribution, or the electoral advantage of endorsing it. Second, people or policymakers may believe that globally redistributive policies are technically impossible or politically infeasible in some key (potentially foreign) countries. % like the U.S. % We intend to test these hypotheses by running a survey on Congress staffers and Members of the European Parliament.  %Second, there may be a more subtle form of pluralistic ignorance: although most people correctly predict what people would answer to a survey question, they may view globally redistributive policies as unrealistic, perhaps because they have never reflected upon the fact that many people across the world hold univeralistic values and are supportive of global solidarity. Third, most people and perhaps even most policy makers may have simply never heard of the GCS, let alone built their political ideas upon it. 
% Third, political discourse centrally happens at the national level, shaped by national media and institutions such as voting. 
% National framing by political voices may create biases and suppress universalistic values. Uncovering evidence to support these hypotheses could %help
% draw attention to global policies in the public debate and contribute to their increased prominence.% Third, most institutions are national: the largest scale votes take place at the national level% so political platforms are devised at this level, most media target a national audience, most commentators frame their discourse from a national perspective and portray relations to foreign countries as conflictual. 
% Fourth, many individuals, including policymakers, may perceive global redistributive policies as ill-defined or technically infeasible, ultimately dismissing them as unrealistic. In particular, policymakers may have insider information about the feasibility of such policies. Alternatively, the perception of unrealism may stem from an unawareness of specific proposals. % cautiously doubt that they are well-specified
% TODO? rewrite as a fifth hypothesis that the policies may indeed not be well specified nor implementable?

% The latter hypothesis is supported by ignorance of the GCS expressed in the feedback fields, where a common response is a variation of ``thank you for this interesting, thought-provoking survey.''

% Also: vested interest influence on elites (a la Gilens and Page for the US, Persson & Sundell 23), cf. Boone story
% decline of support the more specific a measure gets / enters the public debate => addressed in conclusion of pros and cons
% people not believing that the policy is technically implementable => addressed
% politicians seeing defects or lack of specification of the policy that warrant opposition, while ignorant citizens would naively like it => addressed

% LM This are all legtimiate and important points. For a global transfer (rather than say a EU transfer), I am really missing remarks about (lack) of quality of governance, rent creation and capture, corruption etc. To play devil's advocate, as much as I am sympathetic to the idea, I'm not sure I would currently vote in favor of such policies. Why? Not because I dislike the idea, but I am not sure that my carbon tax rent as a German would actually reach the poor population of Indonesia or Nigeria rather than the pockets of cleptocratic elites :) I'd like the draft to reflect that and could make an attempt to pre-empt that objection based on some references later in the project.
%In any case, 

%Confirmation of any of these hypotheses would lead to a common conclusion: there exists substantial support for global policies addressing climate change and global inequality, even in high-income countries, and the perceived boundaries of political realism on this issue may soon shift. Uncovering evidence to support these hypotheses could %help
%draw attention to global policies in the public debate and contribute to their increased prominence. % Uncovering evidence for this might actually contribute itself to garner more attention to global policies in the public debate. % TODO? remove? 65 w

% Also: no short term outcome (before the end of the mandate) so no incentive to start it

% TODO!? alternative conclusion: strong and sincere support for global wealth tax in both continents => probable reason why it's not more discussed is that it's not the determining issue for voters. Strong and sincere support for the GCS in Europe but half-half in the U.S. (where there is a risk that support decreases in a campaign) => not endorsed by the Democrats because they seek policies more strongly supported, and not discussed in Europe probably because the U.S. won't support it.

% The paper relies on two different sets of surveys. The first set of surveys was conducted between March 2021 and March 2022 on 40,680 respondents from 20 countries  (between 1,465 and 2,488 respondents per country). The first U.S. complementary, denoted \textit{US1}, was conducted on 3,000 U.S. respondents between January and March 2023, while the second, \textit{US2}, was conducted on 2,000 respondents between March and April 2023. The \textit{Eu} complementary survey was conducted on 3,000 respondents between February and March 2023. We used the survey companies \emph{Dynata} and \emph{Respondi}. Stratified quotas ensure that the samples are representative along the dimensions of gender, age (5 brackets), income (4), region (4), education level (3), as well as ethnicity (3) for the U.S. To correct for small remaining imbalances, we apply survey weights throughout the analysis, constructed using the quotas variables as well as the degree of urbanity, and trimmed between 0.25 and 4. Weights make the results fully representative of the country (or of the four European countries combined in the case of results at the European level, where different weights are used). Appendix \ref{app:representativeness} confirms that our samples are representative of the population. % TODO! and urbanity instead of education for OECD, TODO table representativeness

The paper utilizes two sets of surveys: the \textit{Global} survey and the \textit{Complementary} surveys. The \textit{Complementary} surveys consist of two U.S. surveys, \textit{US1} and \textit{US2}, and one European survey, \textit{Eu}. The \textit{Global} survey was conducted from March 2021 to March 2022 on 40,680 respondents from 20 countries (with 1,465 to 2,488 respondents per country). \textit{US1} collected responses from 3,000 respondents between January and March 2023, while \textit{US2} gathered data from 2,000 respondents between March and April 2023. \textit{Eu} included 3,000 respondents and was conducted from February to March 2023. We used the survey companies \emph{Dynata} and \emph{Respondi}. To ensure representative samples, we employed stratified quotas based on gender, age (5 brackets), income (4), region (4), and education level (3), as well as ethnicity (3) for the U.S. We also incorporated survey weights throughout the analysis to account for any remaining imbalances. These weights were constructed using the quota variables as well as the degree of urbanity, and trimmed between 0.25 and 4. By applying weights, the results are fully representative of the respective countries. Results at the European level apply different weights which ensure  representativeness of the combined four European countries. 
Supplementary Section G confirms 
that our samples closely match population frequencies in high-income countries. In middle-income countries, the samples are only representative of the online population (young, graduated and urban people are over-represented). Supplementary Material I shows that the treatment branches are balanced. Supplementary Material J runs placebo tests of the effects of each treatment on unrelated outcomes. We do not find effects of earlier treatments on unrelated outcomes arriving later in the survey. %due to the over-representation of young, educated, and urban populations in the online sample

The median duration is 28 minutes for the \textit{Global} survey, 14 min for \textit{US1}, 11 min for \textit{US2}, and 20 min for \textit{Eu}. To ensure the best possible data quality, we exclude respondents who fail an attention test or rush through the survey (i.e., answer in less than 11.5 minutes in the \textit{Global} survey, 4 minutes in \textit{US1} or \textit{US2}, 6 minutes in \textit{Eu}). %All the results and analyses use survey weights, defined to make the results fully representative of the country (or of Eu in the case of results at the Eu level) along the quota variables. Weights are trimmed to be between .25 and 4. 
%\textit{Ex post}, we checked that there were only a few careless response patterns (such as choosing the same answer for all items in a matrix of questions; see Appendix \ref{app:data_quality}). At the end of the survey, we ask whether respondents thought that our survey was politically biased and provide some feedback. 67\% of the respondents found the survey unbiased. 25\% found it left-wing biased, and 8\% found it right-wing biased.

% Possible confusion in the questionnaire: people confuse GCS with the four policies together (so support for GCS can suffer from dislike of death penalty), although this confusion is mitigating by the fact that we right after ask about NR; people may answer about revenue-use rather than the whole measure for ETS2 support; people may answer that GCS will or will not have the effects proposed rather than these effects being important or not in their attitude toward GCS; they may answer that it's important that others (not them) get more information; the minimum wage could be reduced at 50% of local median wage.

In the donation lottery question, we randomly select one respondent and split the \$100 prize between the NGO GiveDirectly and the winner according to the winner's choice. In total, our incentives scheme distributes gift certificates (and donations) for a value of \$850. Finally, respondents have an incentive to answer truthfully to the petition question, as they are aware that the results for that question (the share of respondents supporting the policy) will be transmitted to the head of state's office.

% Here is a description of a specific method used.  Note that the subsection heading ends with a full stop (period) and that the command is \verb|\subsection*{}| not \verb|\subsection**{}|.
% \subsection*{\small Details on sources, methodology and results} % WPcomment

\subsection*{\small Support for the GCS} The 95\% confidence intervals are $[52.4\%, 55.9\%]$ in the U.S. and $[74.2\%, 77.2\%]$ in Europe. The average support is computed with survey weights, employing weights based on quota variables, which exclude vote. Another method to reweigh the raw results involves running a regression of the support for the GCS on sociodemographic characteristics (including vote) and multiplying each coefficient by the population frequencies. This alternative approach yields similar figures: 76\% in Europe and 52\% or 53\% in the U.S. (depending on whether individuals who did not disclose their vote are classified as non-voters or excluded). Notably, the average support excluding non-voters is 54\% in the U.S. 

Though the level of support for the GCS is significantly lower in swing States (at 51\%) that are key to win U.S. elections, the electoral effect of endorsing the GCS remains non-significantly different from zero (at +1.2 p.p.) in these States. Note that we define swing states as the 8 states with less than 5 p.p. margin of victory in the 2020 election (MI, NV, PA, WI, AZ, GA, NC, FL). The results are robust to using the 3 p.p. threshold (that excludes FL) instead. 

\subsection*{\small Global wealth tax estimates}
A 2\% tax on net wealth exceeding \$5 million would annually raise \$816 billion, leaving unaffected 99.9\% of the world population. More specifically, it would collect \euro{}5 billion in Spain, \euro{}16 billion in France, £20 billion in the UK, \euro{}44 billion in Germany, \$430 billion in the U.S., and \$1 billion collectively in all low-income countries (28 countries, home to 700 million people). These Figures come from the \href{https://wid.world/world-wealth-tax-simulator/}{WID wealth tax simulator}.\cite{chancel_world_2022}

\subsection*{\small List experiment}
We utilize the difference-in-means estimator, and confidence intervals are computed using Monte Carlo simulation with the R package \textit{list}.\cite{imai_multivariate_2011}

\subsection*{\small Petition}
Paired weighted \textit{t}-tests are conducted to test the equality in support for a policy among respondents who were questioned about the policy in the petition.

\subsection*{\small Conjoint analysis}
The effects reported in the fourth analyses are the Average Marginal Component Effects.\cite{hainmueller_causal_2014} This method is common in the literature that explores attitudes towards taxation.\cite{bechtel_reforms_2020,ballard-rosa_structure_2017} The policies studied are progressive policies prominent in the country. Except for the category \textit{foreign policy}, which features the GCS 42\% of the time, they are drawn uniformly.

\subsection*{\small Prioritization}
The prioritization (Question 58, Supplementary Figures A29 and A30) allows inferring individual-level preferences for one policy over another. This slightly differs from a conjoint analysis, which only allows inferring individual-level preferences for one platform over another or collective-level preferences for one policy over another. Also, by comparing platforms, conjoint analyses may be subject to interaction effects between policies of a platform (which can be seen as complementary, subsitute, or antagonistic) while the prioritization frames the policies as independent.

\subsection*{\small Pros and cons}
Surprisingly, the support for National Redistribution also decreased by 7 p.p. following the closed question about the GCS. This suggests that some individuals may lack attention and confuse the two policies, or that contemplating the pros and cons alters the mood of some people, moving them away from their initial positive impression.

\subsection*{\small Determinants of support}
Supplementary Section F examines the sociodemographic determinants of support for the GCS as well as the beliefs correlated with the support for a global tax on GHG financing a global basic income. The strongest correlates are political leaning, trust in the government and perceptions that the policy is effective at reducing emissions or in one's self-interest.

% General comments:
% I prefer my version of the intro
% I prefer to keep all graphs
% The new wording is often less direct/simple and more sophisticated/formal. e.g. "a large majority of Americans expressed that more help is needed" vs. "a significant majority of Americans emphasized the need for increased assistance". Not sure it's always better to be too formal. It is often less clear, and I think it add lengths. e.g. "In our conjoint analyses, we ask respondents to make five choices between pairs of political platforms." vs. "In order to assess the public support for the GCS in conjunction with other policies, we conducted a series of conjoint analyses. We asked respondents to make five choices between pairs of political platforms."
% Subsubsections, not paragraphs, for complementary survey results.
% Lacks results on how to finance more foreign aid. 
% present vs. past tense
% Influence of pros & cons
% Concluding paragraph in universalistic values?
