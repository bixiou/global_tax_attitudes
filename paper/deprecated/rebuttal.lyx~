This study investigates the level and predictors of public support for the
 Global Climate Scheme which consists of introducing a global carbon pricing
 mechanism whose revenues would fund a universal basic income.
 The analysis of survey data from over 20 countries suggests that the policy
 finds supermajoritarian support in Europe and majority support in the United
 States.
 The main conclusion is that the Global Climate Scheme is preferred by a
 robust majority across countries and that “the expressed preference is
 sincere”.

We can infer from the paper that people would be indifferent between status
 quo and a policy that cost them 1k$ and increase income of the poorest
 by 5k$.
 Or that a majority would support a policy that doubles the income of the
 poorest (Americans) and reduce their income by 1k$.
 This is close to what we find.

 The authors highlight that there is no “significant policy proposal” on
 the table but that could also be a weakness of the study: did individuals
 know anything about this somewhat complex policy reform? Relatedly, how
 plausible is it from the perspective of both mass publics and experts that
 such a global policy would ever materialize? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 There is a significant disconnect between the claims about support for
 the global climate scheme and the actual survey item meant to elicit preference
s over such a policy.
 That item merely asks “at which level(s) do you think public policies to
 tackle climate change need to be put in place?” (lines 80-81).
 But asking such a broad and amorphous question does not seem to be informative
 about the level of support for a rather specific, costly, and strongly
 redistributive global reform.
 It could be useful to focus more directly on the studies that are clearly
 focused on the actual policy question.

 Similarly, it remains vague how preferences over dividing a carbon budget
 relates to the research question/claims.
 Also, one wonders whether these findings about burden-sharing resonate
 with existing research on this topic.
 The SI section A.1.2 is quite eclectic about how it portrays existing research
 on this topic and that review includes “staff discussion notes”

 papers instead of focusing on high-quality public opinion work published
 in expert journals.
 Think of the increasingly large literature on cost aversion and compensation
 (e.g., Gaikwad et al.
 2022 APSR and the literature cited therein).

Gaikwad et al.
 2022 is about how to allocate the revenues of a carbon tax within a country

 other purposes).
 It has nothing to do with burden-sharing between countries.

 A key question is whether the predicted levels of support are plausible,
 especially since the policy would entail considerable redistribution that
 would require exceptional and maybe even unprecedented levels of international
 administrative coordination with respect to both the extraction of resources
 and their re-allocation.
 I currently am missing a strategy to address the argument that the high
 levels of support reflect the fact that many respondents simply discount
 the reform as being purely speculative, having a close-to-zero probability
 of ever materializing, and lacking any clear (personal) costs above and
 beyond that any costs would fall on the very rich and respondents therefore
 think they would be net beneficiaries.
 The importance of (personal) costs has been documented in existing experimental
 global climate policy research and the findings suggest that a moderate
 increase in personal costs could lead to sizable shifts in public support
 even if there is a causally identified preference for allocating costs
 in line with fairness norms such as the ability-to-pay principle (see Bechtel
 and Scheve 2013 PNAS).
 This is in some sense consistent with the descriptive patterns report in
 Figure 2 and it would be helpful to make this explicit and think about
 possible explanations.
 Overall, however, it seems that any study intending to generate predicted
 levels of support for the types of global and unprecedented policies would
 have to carefully account for cost sensitivities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 This is related to the potential role of the list experiment as an attempt
 to address social desirability concerns.
 This problem would be particularly relevant if a policy is highly ethically
 sensitive or very politicized.
 But the main concern with the current study would be about the lack of
 a clear and somewhat attributable cost component.
 Also, Table 1 does not provide any information about what is being reported
 here and how the quantities have been estimated which is inconsistent with
 accepting transparent reporting standards.
 It is also somewhat misleading to claim that any differences here would
 indicate (through the wording selected for this table) that these reflect
 social desirability bias.
 There could be many alternatives explanations such as interaction effects
 between the proposed alternatives, e.g., beliefs about the political and
 economic consequences of pursuing multiple policies simultaneously that
 are unrelated to social desirability.

 by adding the points component to assess a selection of previously shown
 profiles improves over existing work.
 To be clear, there could be a good reason for this design, but one would
 have to make that reason explicit.
 Moreover, these results again show that taxing the rich is the overriding
 concern.
 Since this finding conflicts with what we know about tax policy preferences
 (at least in the US, see Ballard et al.

; Scheve/Stasavage 2022 CPS), one would have to acknowledge this discrepancy
 which raises questions about the validity of the findings.
 One could begin exploring this issue by analyzing the results for the US
 separately although there are obvious limits to what can be realized within
 the current design framework due to comparability issues.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 There is also the issue of effectiveness and financing portion of such
 a global policy scheme.
 How plausible is it that taxing the richest would generate sufficient revenue?
 Moreover, one would want to know more about the mechanisms that explain
 mass preferences.
 For example, to what extent is it those who care strongly about addressing
 global warming who support drastic reforms? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 The study connects a wide range of policy fields (tax policy, global climate
 action, novel decisionmaking bodies, foreign aid, …) and this renders the
 paper difficult to digest and the main contribution appears (unnecessarily?)
 somewhat superficial.

 Is all the material presented sufficiently original given that Figure 1
 is taken from an NBER working paper? Also, I am wondering whether the referenci
ng is correct since NBER working paper 1714 is from 1985 and on “Does Deductibil
ity Influence Local Taxation”.
 Instead, Figure 1 seems to come from the “OECD Economics Department Working
 Paper, 1714.” The figure has also been used in an 2022 op-ed, see: https://cepr.o

 Overall, the study and the survey design remains opaque at times.
 For example, the survey structure seems to have included so many conditions
 and skip-/assignment logics that it is hard to make sense of the results
 in terms of experimental conditions and potential order effects.
 It is also unclear how the Figure A8 results should be interpreted given
 that it includes a range of policy reforms across multiple issue areas.

 Lastly, the title could be more informative about the content of the study.
 Also, it would be useful to convey the key finding or relationship that
 is investigated in the study in the title.

\begin_layout Standard
The paper is in many ways a fun and interesting read, but my sense is that
 it doesn't reach the general interest bar of Nature Sustainability.
 A main reason behind me reaching that conclusion is that the policies discussed
 in the papers are generally formulated in very abstract terms.
 In the demand for redistribution literature one generally observes high
 agreement to general statements about the importance of things like increased
 equality and environmental sustainability.
 However, when policies become more concrete, and when it becomes clear
 who will actually be impacted, there is generally much less support.
 There are also often treatment effects from e.g.
 information present in the abstract, but not for concrete policies.
 For this reason, the generalizability of findings similar to the ones presented
 here are limited.
 This does, in itself, not preclude the paper from being published, but
 it diminishes its external validity significantly.
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It may be true that support for global redistributive policies would be
 lower if they were becoming more concrete, but we cannot test that until
 they enter the public debate.
 We used all the methods available to us to test whether support for global
 redistributive policies is genuine.
 Our paper indicates that they may be supported once they enter the public
 debate, and is thus the first step to test whether attitudes will change
 once global redistribution is debated.
 To us, it is a result in itself that such policies are supported, even
 if this support might prove transitory.
 Preventing the publication of such a result on the ground that opinions
 may change means preventing the publication of any research on attitudes
 towards global redistributive policies, and more generally any policy that
 is now currently part of the public debate.

\end_layout

I also partly defer re the paper’s novelty, but if the work here has not
 already been done elsewhere, then it seems of sufficient novelty to warrant
 publication in Nature Sustainability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I advocate for a revise and resubmit based on what I am knowledgeable about,
 as my impression is that this article provides useful and important new
 knowledge – with the proviso that the methods are approved by other reviewers,
 and that other reviewers identify no good reason to doubt it is above the
 minimum bar of novelty.
 From a political point of view, it is important to know how many people
 say they would support different policies, including the GCS policy that
 is one of the authors’ focal points, and how robust those responses appear
 to be.
 From a wellbeing, equity, and poverty alleviation point of view, the authors’
 numbers check out regarding something on the order of $30/person/month
 in global carbon revenue would be generated with the magnitude of carbon
 pricing they consider, which could have important poverty alleviation implicati
ons if invested in pro-poverty alleviation ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the same time, there were a few questions I had that seemed important
 to clarify in the text – some important issues are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Do the authors’ poverty calculations tacitly assume that the global poor
 do not bear any of the costs from large carbon pricing schemes such as
 GCS, and somehow only receive benefits via the equal per capita distribution
 of the revenues? If so, this might appear to some readers to be a complication
 for their poverty calculations, because realistically the poor will bear
 some of the mitigation costs – instead, the correct focus for poverty calculati
ons would be the net benefit, ie for a representative individual below the
 poverty line, we need to know that individual’s net benefit = the carbon
 dividend they receive minus the additional mitigation cost they bear from
 the carbon pricing scheme (due to decreased economic growth affecting them,
 higher fuel and other costs of goods, etc).
 In other words, if the carbon dividend for those below the poverty line
 is $30 per person, we then need to subtract from that amount the increased
 costs for those individuals from higher priced energy, goods, foregone
 wages etc in order to know how much better off they are on balance under
 the carbon pricing scheme.
 Without anticipating this issue, a skeptical reader might worry that these
 costs turn out to be a high percentage of the benefits from the carbon
 dividend, thus undermining the reported poverty alleviation benefits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the authors have already accounted for mitigation cost in their poverty
 alleviation calculations, they should state this and briefly explain this
 in more detail in the text.
 Currently, the authors seem to say only that “The 700 million people with
 less than $2/day would be lifted out of extreme poverty, and fossil fuel
 price increases would cost the typical person in their country a specified
 amount (see Supplementary Section D).” However, supplementary Section D
 does not explain anything relevant to this issue (as far as I see), but
 rather simply explains how different survey respondents in rich countries
 are told that their own consumption will be decreased by additional mitigation
 cost in their own rich country.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I’ve not misunderstood the situation, and the authors have in fact not
 accounted for the mitigation cost burden for the poor, perhaps a solution
 is to cite a paper that quantifies that the net benefits will be large
 for those at the bottom of the income distribution from a scheme like GCS,
 and thus that the net benefits are large as the benefits for the poorest
 greatly exceed the mitigation costs.
 For one specific set of results that does this, in a paper the authors
 already cite, see Supplementary Figure 4 (especially panel C) of Budolfson
 et al “Climate action with revenue recycling has benefits for poverty,
 inequality and well-being”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 A further issue is that the authors could be more clear about how many
 people they claim would be lifted out of poverty by their central GCS scenario.
 Here is a simple way of explaining one reason why this is important and
 involves a further complication: even if we ignore the issue in the previous
 comment and thus focus only on the per capita carbon dividend, by the authors’
 own lights the carbon dividend is only $1/day (= $30/month).
 So, if we want to know how many people will be lifted out of poverty, where
 that means living on more than $2/day, it is not obvious how many people
 that would be if all we know is that every person will get an additional
 $1/day? (It depends on how many of the poorest people are close enough
 to the $2/day line that the extra amount puts them over that threshold.
 In addition, this illustrates the importance of the issue in the previous
 comment, since if the net benefit for each person in poverty is less than
 $1/day, this will also effect how many people are raised for the first
 time above the $2/day threshold.) The authors’ seem to assert without further
 analysis that “The 700 million people with less than $2/day would be lifted
 out of extreme poverty”.
 (see textbox – note that this quote from the authors most naturally is
 taken to be saying that *everyone in the world* would be lifted out of
 extreme poverty, but it is unclear why we should be convinced that is so
 for the reasons just given.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data underlying the Budolfson et al paper referenced above would answer
 these questions, but for some reason their paper does not seem to have
 reported those specific numbers anywhere (ie it does not specifically report
 what % of those below $2/day would be lifted above $2/day in a GCS-like
 scenario).
 Perhaps these numbers are available from another published paper, or perhaps
 Budolfson et al would be willing to provide them if useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 As a side-note, perhaps worth somehow bringing out the subtlety of this
 a bit: if we change the world so that everyone who was previously living
 on less than $2/day is now living on $2.50/day, it is not clear that we
 have really ended extreme poverty (as the $2/day threshold does not mark
 a deeply precise and dramatic distinction in quality of life)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Within Fig 1 and Supplementary Information Fig S1, the authors say that
 the GCS scenario divides a 2deg global carbon budget into “tradable country
 shares”.
 Can the authors explain explicitly how these “country shares” are determined
 and thus how this is equivalent to the GCS scenario described in the main
 text (since the text does not otherwise refer to “country shares” as far
 as I can see).
 Eg is each country’s share of the total global permits simply that country’s
 % of global population? Simply adding that information would be sufficient
 (if that is correct) – but this isn’t completely clear from the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 The figures in the main text say that “The numbers represent the percentage
 of somewhat or strong support, after excluding indifferent answers.” Is
 it a strong custom to report results in this way in this kind of context?
 It seemed odd to me, as it seemed to inflate the levels of support.
 (It is also a little opaque to the reader given it is the only way of reporting
 things in the main text, given that an unknown and arbitrarily large %
 of the population could be indifferent – eg if 99% are indifferent, and
 the remaining 1% are all in favor, that would be reported as 100% in favor?).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I defer to the customary norms of how to report things if there is a strong
 customary norm in favor of reporting the data in the way the authors have.
 Otherwise I’d prefer the absolute % as reported in SI A3.
 (The authors could also consider reporting both numbers in the main text
 together, with the coloring based on one metric, but perhaps add the other
 in parentheses, eg a question that has a relative % of 84 and absolute
 % of 64 could be reported as “84 (64)”.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 A small issue: I thought GCS should not be described as a “Climate Club”
 (see textbox pg 8), as in the literature a climate club typically refers
 to a proper subset of nations that coordinate action together either to
 benefit themselves directly in some way, or to indirectly benefit themselves
 by getting other nations to deepen their mitigation efforts? (I don’t think
 this is anything to worry about in the survey, just could come across as
 a bit of a distracting misnomer.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 Perhaps in the main text the authors should more explicitly situate their
 contribution relative to Carattini, S., Kallbekken, S.
 & Orlov, A.
 How to win public support for a global carbon tax.
 Nature 565, 289–291 (2019).
 This doesn’t require any big reframing or revisions, but perhaps just a
 sentence or two?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
8.
 I thought for a broad audience it could be explained a little more explicitly
 what a “real-stake petition” is, and same for the other terms in this key
 sentence: “By employing a list experiment, a real-stake petition, and conjoint
 analyses, our study indicates genuine and robust support for the GCS among
 respondents.
 For example, the conjoint analyses provide evidence that political parties
 would not lose vote intention by endorsing the GCS.” Explain and connect
 the dots more explicitly for a broad audience about what these things mean,
 and how they imply the conclusions the authors claim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
9.
 Regarding why politicians do not advocate GCS, the authors say “we hypothesized
 pluralistic ignorance, i.e.
 that the public and policymakers mistakenly perceive the GCS as unpopular”.
 I thought a different approach might be for the authors in this article
 to be more agnostic about the explanation absent much deeper political
 science analysis, while noting that there are several plausible explanations,
 including this one? (It seems to require much more argument to advance
 the authors’ explanation, which is not the focus of the paper here.) Eg
 a different explanation is that politicians are focused on marginal voters
 who might be indifferent in the majority, but in some cases would see support
 of GCS as a reason to veto the candidate whereas failing to support GCS
 as a main plank in their platform is not seen as a reason not to support
 the candidate.
 Other explanations are possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
10.
 This doesn’t necessarily require any changes, but wanted to note that the
 authors say: “A global quota with equal per capita emission rights produces
 the same distributional outcomes as a global carbon tax that funds a global
 basic income.” In theory yes, but what about in practice? Some might think
 that these differ in attractiveness in reality, perhaps due to real-world
 complications of the sort that are the focus of political economy, administrati
ve feasibility, etc.
 (Eg if experts were asked the same survey questions, they might differ
 in their support for each based on these considerations.)
