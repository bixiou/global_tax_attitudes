Dear Dr.
 Alamanos,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
we would like to appeal the rejection decision as it appears to us that
 reviewers #1 and #2 made substantial errors of fact in their reports:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a.
 The rejection recommendation of reviewer #2 is based on the mistaken claim
 that 
\shape italic

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the policies discussed in the papers are generally formulated in very abstract
 terms
\shape default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Yet, the policies discussed in the paper are described in great detail
 to the respondents, as show the Questionnaires in Appendices C and D.
 In particular, the net cost to the typical fellow citizen (e.g.
 $85 per month in the U.S.) is specified when describing the Global Climate
 Scheme (GCS).
 We also ask incentivized comprehension questions and provide the correct
 answer that the GCS would benefit the 700 million poorest humans and harm
 typical fellow citizens.
 Similarly, the questions on the millionaire tax clearly specifies who will
 contribute (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

households with net worth above $5 million
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and how the revenues would be used (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

finance infrastructure and public services in low-income countries
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Therefore, the allusion by reviewer #2 that the policies are not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

concrete
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and that it is not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clear who will actually be impacted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 seems unwarranted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b.
 Relatedly, in their point 3, reviewer #1 argues that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\shape italic
There is a significant disconnect between the claims about support for the
 global climate scheme and the actual survey item meant to elicit preferences
 over such a policy.
 That item merely asks “at which level(s) do you think public policies to
 tackle climate change need to be put in place?” (lines 80-81).
 But asking such a broad and amorphous question does not seem to be informative
 about the level of support for a rather specific, costly, and strongly
 redistributive global reform
\shape default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Yet, the broad question about the level at which climate policies are needed
 is 
\shape italic
not
\shape default
 the question asking support for the GCS.
 Although it seemed clear to us that the two questions are separate (from
 the fact that they are treated in different subsections and that the results
 are exposed in different figures), perhaps this confusion explains the
 misunderstanding of reviewers #1 and #2.
 It could be easily addressed by slightly rewording some sentences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More generally, the reports of reviewers #1 and #2 seem anchored in their
 priors concerning people's attitudes towards global redistribution.
 In short, we used the literature's best practice to uncover these attitudes,
 testing whether the stated support is sincere with a range of methods.
 In our view, that the results may be counterintuitive even to some experts
 should be all the more reason to publish them.
 Let me stress that my previous co-authors and myself were also impressed
 by the results for the global survey showing massive support for global
 redistributive policies, and were cautious not to include them in our paper
 (Dechezleprêtre et al., 2022) for fear that this new result could be explained
 away by some factors (like a lack of sincerity).
 We then designed pre-registered complementary surveys to better understand
 the stated support, and the results confirmed that this support is genuine.

\begin_layout Standard
We provide a point-by-point rebuttal to each comment by the three reviewers
 in attachment.
