This can create jobs and opportunities for people in low-income countries to lift themselves out of poverty. \n Provide debt relief: High-income countries can provide debt relief to low-income countries burdened by debt, allowing them to invest more in their own development and poverty-reduction efforts. \n Address global health challenges: High-income countries can work with low-income countries to address global health challenges, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and maternal and child health. These efforts can improve health outcomes and reduce poverty. \n Promote good governance: High-income countries can support efforts to promote good governance in low-income countries, including anti-corruption measures, human rights protections, and democratic institutions.
