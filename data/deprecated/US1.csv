The United States of America needs to get its butt out of other countries and their business. Giving constant aid to other countries has made us a weak country. We’re already becoming a third-world country, which is what our crooked government and elites (and other countries waiting to pounce) want. The proposal of “$30.00 a month to lift others out of poverty” is INSANE. How stupid do people think Americans are? Wait - don’t answer that. Americans have gone backwards, when it comes to knowledge. We were once strong and people took pride in learning. But nobody wants to learn anything anymore. Nobody reads anymore. The average 21 year old today, reads at a second and third grade level, if that, from when I was in school in the late 1960’s and early 1970s. And they haven’t willingly picked up a book to read, EVER. The average young American today has no attention span, has no interest in learning about the history of our country; other countries; no interest in writing; or artistic subjects. Their imaginations have been stunted. They truly cannot think for themselves. They’ve become so accustomed to movies and TV shows doing the thinking for them, that they are living in a fog. I’m so grateful that my childhood was in America, and in such a wonderful era. But it makes it hurt much more seeing it being trampled on and thrown away by the Americans of today. My father fought in The Battle of the Bulge right after turning 18 and graduating high school. He and his regiment freed death camps in Germany. The majority of the 18 year olds of today would not be capable of fighting in WWII. My father had two Purple Hearts. The majority of young Americans today wouldn’t even know what a Purple Heart meant. They would assume it was a Smartphone emoji. 
While reading this survey, I noticed the measures discussed were called “schemes.” That’s a really good example of a “Freudian Slip”, because that is exactly what they are; “schemes”. Designed to make those in government, and the elites, wealthier. 
There is NO WAY our government is going to allow other countries to see even one penny of that money. They’ll be funneling it right into their own pockets. 
The further I read, the more I began to actually think this whole thing was meant as a joke. I kept waiting for the: “Just Kidding”! to show up! “…$30.00 a month lifting others out of poverty”? Are these people KIDDING?!? 
Oh, don’t get me wrong. It IS a nice phrase. I’m very impressed by those choice of words. It has a nice ring to it, too, and just enough so as to pull at the heartstrings of gullible people. 
There’s a difference in giving “aid” to others. Disaster aid is one thing. But giving to those who hate us, and they do, will only increase their hatred. And it has. Giving them weapons wasn’t too bright. Giving them access to our military’s machines and mechanics wasn’t too bright, either. In fact, it was so utterly stupid, that I honestly believe it was all by design. It was done on purpose. 
Just as the jabs were. I believe they were created long before the C-19 virus. It’s all been planned. It is so obviously a way for our government (and others involved) to get rid of the useless “eaters”, as the Nazis called the elderly and infirm. And, a way to enslave others. Well, you know the saying: “There is none so blind as those who will not see.”
