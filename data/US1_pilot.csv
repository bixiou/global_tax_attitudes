I am generally completely neutral however these issues that I agree should be taken care of are commonly associated with one party over the other.

I However remain Politically neutral despite and individual beliefs I have that associate with either party.

I would also like to add that this Survey was of high quality and appreciate the effort dedicated to making it that way.
