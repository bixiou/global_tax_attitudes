If you cannot afford to feed your family you should work even more or the government should step in and take your children until you are in a better position. There is no reason for you to have children if you cannot feed them yourself. Family planning is essential to a successful society. So for me personally that would mean access to abortion, birth control and better sex education in our schools. Another way to fight extreme poverty is to teach people how to live off of the land. Create their own food, own clothes how to work with their hands. As well as making sure that affordable secondary education is available so they can go be doctors, lawyers etc. Without having to pay so much money in student loans. As well as there should be more protections against money sharks in businesses that take advantage of people.","No, I do not feel it was biased",Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1038,1,,2,South,0,0,1,EN,97916_05f9b11c,97916,97916,97916,97916,239169644680354,,1,,,,,,1,5,2,,3,,4,,,1,,1,
