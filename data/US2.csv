Such as by working, providing services, being educated. As well as I think there should be massive cuts to any food stamps or wic programs. If you cannot afford to feed your family you should work even more or the government should step in and take your children until you are in a better position. There is no reason for you to have children if you cannot feed them yourself. Family planning is essential to a successful society. So for me personally that would mean access to abortion, birth control and better sex education in our schools. Another way to fight extreme poverty is to teach people how to live off of the land. Create their own food, own clothes how to work with their hands. As well as making sure that affordable secondary education is available so they can go be doctors, lawyers etc. Without having to pay so much money in student loans. As well as there should be more protections against money sharks in businesses that take advantage of people.","No, I do not feel it was biased",Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1038,1,,2,South,0,0,1,EN,97916_05f9b11c,97916,97916,97916,97916,,,1,,,,,,1,5,2,,3,,4,,,1,,1,,,,,

Here are a few:

Provide foreign aid: High-income countries can provide foreign aid in the form of financial assistance, technical expertise, and resources to help low-income countries address poverty and promote development.
Support economic growth: High-income countries can support economic growth in low-income countries by promoting trade, investment, and entrepreneurship. This can create jobs and opportunities for people in low-income countries to lift themselves out of poverty.
Provide debt relief: High-income countries can provide debt relief to low-income countries burdened by debt, allowing them to invest more in their own development and poverty-reduction efforts.
Address global health challenges: High-income countries can work with low-income countries to address global health challenges, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and maternal and child health. These efforts can improve health outcomes and reduce poverty.
Promote good governance: High-income countries can support efforts to promote good governance in low-income countries, including anti-corruption measures, human rights protections, and democratic institutions. This can help create a more stable and prosperous environment for poverty reduction and development.","No, I do not feel it was biased",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,644,,,1,Northeast,0,0,0,EN,97916_05f9b11c,97916,97916,97916,97916,,,1,,,,,,1,5,2,,,3,4,,,,1,,1,,,,
