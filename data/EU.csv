It would make polluters pay for their emissions, which in turn would increase fossil fuel prices and discourage polluting activities. Several options are possible regarding the use of the scheme’s revenues:

	Provide an equal cash transfer of €105 per year to each European.
	Provide a country-specific cash transfer to each European, proportional to their country’s emissions: people in countries with higher emissions per person (like Germany) would receive more than people in countries with lower emissions (like Romania). For information, people in [Country] would receive [country gain]€/year.
	Finance low-carbon investments: the thermal insulation of buildings, the switch to clean sources of heating, public transportation, and charging stations for electric vehicles.
