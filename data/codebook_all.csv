ets2_equal_cash_support,"ets2_equal_cash_support: Similar to the Global Climate Scheme, the European Climate Scheme would impose a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit across the EU in the buildings and transport sectors. It would make polluters pay for their emissions, which in turn would increase fossil fuel prices and discourage polluting activities. Several options are possible regarding the use of the scheme’s revenues:

	Provide an equal cash transfer of €105 per year to each European.
	Provide a country-specific cash transfer to each European, proportional to their country’s emissions: people in countries with higher emissions per person (like Germany) would receive more than people in countries with lower emissions (like Romania). For information, people in [Country] would receive [country gain]€/year.
	Finance low-carbon investments: the thermal insulation of buildings, the switch to clean sources of heating, public transportation, and charging stations for electric vehicles.
