Now the four categories you saw separately will appear together. Remember, each word/image fits in only one of the four categories. The label/item colors may help you identify the appropriate category.




Use the E key for the two categories on the left and the I key for the two categories on the right. Again, try to go as fast as possible without making mistakes. Correct errors by hitting the other key. Practice this combination now.

Now the four categories you saw separately will appear together. Remember, each word/image fits in only one of the four categories. The label/item colors may help you identify the appropriate category.




Use the E key for the two categories on the left and the I key for the two categories on the right. Again, try to go as fast as possible without making mistakes. Correct errors by hitting the other key. Practice this combination now. 




When you are ready, please press the [Space] bar to begin.
